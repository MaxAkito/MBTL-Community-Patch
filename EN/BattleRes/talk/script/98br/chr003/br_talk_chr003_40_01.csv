10,NONE,"Month X, Day Y
A sunny afternoon on a holiday
at the Tohno estate."
20,Arcueid,I am DONE with billiards!
30,Arcueid,"Playing games with Akiha was fun,
but playing with you sucks, Ciel!"
40,Ciel,"I see. Can you tell me what exactly
sucked, in particular?"
50,Arcueid,"All of it! Once it was your turn,
I never got to go again!"
60,Arcueid,"You just sank all the balls one by one,
in the most boring, safest way!"
70,Arcueid,"Making your opponent wait endlessly for you to mess up is
underhanded. Honestly, Ciel. You agree, right, Shiki?"
80,Ciel,"Thank you for losing so poorly.
It makes playing the game so carefully worth it."
90,Ciel,"Shiki, you would rather have a reliable,
trustworthy upperclassmen, wouldn't you?"
100,Arcueid,"Really. Shiki, tell us what you think. You like the
thrill of a little danger more than staying safe, right?"
110,Shiki,"I'm not sure you really understand the word danger...
But never mind that for now."
120,Shiki,"Billiards can turn into a one-sided game sometimes,
but that's because it's a game of skill."
130,Shiki,"It's not so much ""you get a chance when the opponent misses,""
it's ""you'll win if you play perfectly."""
140,Shiki,"Going by the rules, Ciel's way of playing
is correct, and moreover..."
150,Shiki,"she has the advantage in games that call for
patience and careful play."
160,Shiki,"If you wanted to play a different game with a ball,
I think you would've had better odds in a game like bowling."
170,Akiha,"Right. Billiards is a sport, not a game.
Luck has no impact on the outcome."
180,Akiha,"The players do take turns more often, usually,
but Ciel played really well."
190,Akiha,"Not to mention, going on points, you're almost even.
You're well-matched."
200,Akiha,"Ciel played so well it was inhuman; well enough I felt
like she might as well go pro and leave Japan..."
210,Akiha,"while your style was also inhuman, Arcueid. It made me wonder
if you might find a use for your strength in a coal mine."
220,Ciel,"Indeed. I wasn't sure if your break would sink all the balls
at once, or just disintegrate the cue ball."
230,Ciel,"I was genuinely concerned that someone
might end up dying accidentally."
240,Ciel,"Arcueid should really avoid activities that involve
hitting or striking things, shouldn't she, Shiki?"
250,Ciel,"Or, actually, we should just avoid her altogether."
260,Ciel,She's nothing but trouble.
270,Shiki,"Normally I keep an eye on her,
it's just that you're here today, Ciel."
280,Shiki,"I can always get her to stop,
even if she gets carried away."
290,Shiki,"She only really gets worked up with you, Ciel.
A lot of the time she can't stop talking about you."
300,Arcueid,"What?! I do not get worked up! And since when
has she ever been enough to cause me a problem?!"
310,Shiki,"See what I mean? So I had a lot of fun
watching the two of you play."
320,Shiki,"It's fun being able to really cut loose on someone, isn't it?
You two are such good friends."
330,Ciel, 
340,Akiha, 
350,Arcueid, 
360,Akiha,"*ahem* Arcueid, did you have any other requests?"
370,Akiha,"If you'd like a game for four players at once,
I can think of a few."
380,Arcueid,"Really? Thanks, Akiha."
390,Arcueid,"But I'd rather be alone with Shiki after this.
Is there a lake in that forest?"
400,Arcueid,"I can prepare a boat, so you don't need to
worry about that."
410,Arcueid,"I can make anything with Marble Phantasm.
Did you know Shiki likes swan boats?"
420,Shiki,(Hmph!)
430,Akiha,Shiki.
440,Shiki,What's the matter?
450,Akiha,"I didn't know that. You like those cute
swan boats?"
460,Shiki,"No, not really. They're tacky.
There just wasn't anything else to choose from."
470,Akiha,"And ""there just wasn't"" anything to do
besides go for rides on them several times, with Arcueid?"
480,Akiha,"The Omowazu Spring docks are nearby, right?
Rentals are usually 30 minutes to an hour."
490,Akiha,"What would you have talked about for so long,
with no one to disturb you?"
500,Akiha,Hopefully something important for your future.
510,Akiha,"I'll be waiting to hear all about it in detail later.
*grin*"
520,Shiki,"I was just showing her around town, though.
(Or, well, the area I guess?)"
530,Shiki,"Whoa, was that lightning?!
It was close! Was that in the garden?!"
540,Akiha,"Oh, did the power go out? But it shouldn't be this dark
even with the lights out..."
550,Arcueid,"Is anyone else getting a weird feeling?
Like a chill, or a premonition?"
560,Neco_Arc_Hatena,"Nyahahaha! We did it, Mash!
Finally this is the real MB universe!"
570,Neco_Arc,"Hey there, you bickering heroines! Look at you,
just standing around, gone soft with your guards down!"
580,Neco_Arc,"But the game's up, now that I'm here.
You'll all go back to hating each other, like the old days."
590,Neco_Arc,"New faces, hello, nice to meet you.
And those who know me already, please be gentle."
600,Neco_Arc,"I'm Neco-Arc! The shining actress
who represents all the cats of the spirit village."
610,Neco_Arc,"I'm here now to punish you all
for never having a true main character."
620,Neco_Arc,"And above all else! Hey, you, in the glasses!
How dare you have this saccharine slice-of-life storyline?!"
630,Neco_Arc,"It's going to give me diabetes, so I've got to
make you guys go back to zero-calorie mode!"
635,NONE,"*(With a warm smile that asks "what part of that was sweet exactly?")"
636,NONE," "
640,Arcueid,"Ugh... Actually, I don't feel so great.
I'm feeling dizzy, so I'm gonna go lay down for a bit."
650,Arcueid,"I don't want to get too involved here.
I'll leave the weird stuff to Ciel."
660,Ciel,"That's not fair! You always do this!
Would you stop making me do the dirty work?!"
670,Akiha,"Now, now. Do you know this person, Ciel?
Are you colleagues?"
680,Neco_Arc,"Yes, we're colleagues. If we were in an anime,
we'd have known each other for two seasons already!Åô"
690,Ciel,"Really? I've never seen you before in my life, though."
700,Shiki,"Calm down, Ciel. You know you shouldn't
listen to half of this."
710,Ciel,"Oh, right, of course.
Wait, so you think half of it is true?!"
720,Shiki,"Oh, no, not really.
But still, let's hear her out."
730,Shiki,"Okay, spill it. Why are you here?"
740,Shiki,"This must be extremely urgent, for you
to interrupt Arcueid, Ciel, and Akiha's girls' time."
750,Shiki,"Or have you come to challenge them?
I won't stop you if you want to die."
760,Neco_Arc,"Oh my. You're truly fit to serve the True Ancestor Princess.
Competent enough for a provisional protagonist, at least."
770,Akiha,He doesn't serve her. He's my older brother.
780,Akiha,"Oops, sorry. Did I let that slip out?"
790,Akiha,"Did you just call him 'provisional'...?
Does that mean there's a real protagonist out there?"
800,Neco_Arc,"Of course! Forgetfulness paves the way to sin!
Punishment cleanses us!"
810,Neco_Arc,"Now listen, and I will share with you the long history
of the war between the main and guest characters!"
820,Neco_Arc,"In the beginning there was Re:ACT, AC, AA, then AACC.
It might sound like I'm speaking in code,
but it's the series's history."
830,Neco_Arc,"Did you know we've fought five times,
to our destruction? Are we on the Mayan calendar?"
840,Neco_Arc,"It really is an endless battle between light and dark.
A hopeless sort of survival born of capitalism."
850,Neco_Arc,"The weak have always yielded the spotlight to you lot.
But now..."
860,Neco_Arc,"After long years in obscurity, I'm finally back in the game!"
870,Neco_Arc,"This isn't the main Tsukihime timeline! This is the MB
universe, where peak meta and OP skills rule!"
880,Neco_Arc,"The toughest character will claim the main role in the next
title, that's the rule here!!"
890,Akiha,"So what you're saying is that the eldest son
of our family line isn't fit for the next featured character?"
900,Neco_Arc,"N-No, I wouldn't go that far...
It's, umm, it's meow-re like... uh..."
910,Ciel,"Hmm. So basically, you're saying the idea here is to
claim the spotlight through strength?"
920,Neco_Arc,"Yes! That's it exactly! I knew you'd get it, Ciel."
930,Neco_Arc,We're declaring war on the main cast!
940,Neco_Arc,"It's guest versus main cast! We're staking our survival on
fighting it out to find who's strongest!"
950,Neco_Arc,"Now, let me introduce my warriors,
summoned from other worlds for this battle!"
960,Neco_Arc,"First! With unbeatable defense and merciless strikes,
it's the beautiful, innocent Aegis agent Mash Kyrielight!"
970,Mash,"Y-Yes ma'am! I've heard this will be a clean tournament,
and I'm here to give it my all!"
980,Ciel,"(That shield is a high-level Mystic Code...
 Is she a Mage's Association Royal Guard?)"
990,Neco_Arc,"Second up! The speed demon too fast to see, Ushiwakamaru!
She left her mercy and common sense in the distant past!"
1000,Ushiwaka,"Your wish is my command as a Servant.
I want to complete my task quickly and be freed."
1010,Akiha,"(She doesn't seem very happy to be here.
 And she doesn't look much like a demon, either...)"
1020,Neco_Arc,"And last but not least, someone you all know!
The noble gentleman with a winning smile\sf000! Edmond Dantes!"
1030,Edmond,I know this place! This! This is hell!
1040,Shiki,(I recognize him!)
1050,Akiha,"(Who is he, though?)"
1060,Neco_Arc,"Cat got your tongue? Has my roster of Big Names
left you speechless?!"
1070,Neco_Arc,You see! They're all from the F universe!
1080,Neco_Arc,"Their content operates on a major global scale,
not one tiny neighborhood in a city!"
1090,Neco_Arc,"They're the perfect team to take down that kid in glasses
who's so high and mighty just 'cause he's the main character!"
1100,Shiki,"You're a part of that small-scale story, though.
That's why you're relying on them!"
1110,Neco_Arc,"If it helps me win! I will always
side with the stronger Fate series!"
1120,Ciel,"I'm sorry, Shiki, Miss Akiha...
If only I were more prepared..."
1130,Akiha,"You have nothing to apologize for, Ciel.
But why, though?"
1140,Ciel,"Yes... I don't really understand either,"
1150,Ciel,"but I have a strong feeling that cat is up to no good,
so we have to keep an eye on her."
1160,Ciel,"I feel like everything that creature does
is on me, somehow..."
1170,Akiha,"That's... I can see you have a strong sense of duty
and self-sacrifice, but that's..."
1180,Shiki,...
1190,Shiki,"It's fine. We just have to beat those three, right?
Let's send these intruders running."
1200,Shiki,"I stay main character if I win. If they win,
it's hell on earth here, that's all."
1210,Neco_Arc,"Whoa. Why are you so confident?
It's kind of scary."
1220,Neco_Arc,"But it will be your undoing!
Four versus four..."
1230,Neco_Arc,"The armored girl match of Mash versus Ciel,
the dark haired match of Ushi versus the rich girl,"
1240,Neco_Arc,"the pretty boy match of that guy versus glasses,"
1250,Neco_Arc,"and the blonde main heroine match,
with me versus the original. That was the plan, but..."
1260,Neco_Arc,"if you want a free-for-all, I'm up for that too!"
1270,Neco_Arc,"I'm a Hollywood star, after all.
I won't break, even if those three go down."
1280,Neco_Arc,"All of you MB universe characters are going to
recognize me as a top-tier character!"
1290,Neco_Arc,"Come to me, Great Cat's Coliseum!
A grand theater for our epic show!"
1300,Akiha,Huh?! We've shifted to another dimension!
1310,Akiha,"That's not strange in itself, but the quality of the audience
is making me ill."
1320,Neco_Arc,"Yes, thank you for sharing what everyone
was already thinking."
1330,Neco_Arc,"Now, for our first fight!
Boss Rush mode ver. 3, B vs. F edition!"
1340,Neco_Arc,Let the games begin!
1350,Mash,"H-Huh? I heard I'd be fighting a juggernaut
the Church rebuilt with magic..."
1360,Mash,"Is that really you? You don't look like a magician
or an Executor..."
1370,Shiki,"That's right, I'm just a student.
Take it easy on me if you feel guilty."
1380,Shiki,"(It's obvious she's being tricked into this... That's
 not really my problem, but I'm still kind of worried...)"
1390,Shiki,"Oh well, it's nothing to worry about.
I just need to win."
1400,Shiki,"We know our own limits, I'm sure.
Let's just try to avoid any major injuries."
1410,Mash,"R-Right! I, Mash Kyrielight, will consider this
a chance to learn from an expert!"
