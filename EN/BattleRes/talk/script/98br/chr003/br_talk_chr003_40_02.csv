10,Ushiwaka,"Well! I was certain that the woman beside you
would be the one to face me..."
20,Ushiwaka,"That weapon is called a knife? Even I look down on anyone
wielding something so stubby."
30,Shiki,"She's a sheltered little rich girl.
She isn't suited to rough stuff like this."
40,Shiki,"Not only that, but she's my darling little sister.
I'm the one on guard duty, so I won't let her face a warrior."
50,Ushiwaka,"So you're protecting her as a brother.
Very well. You are a fitting opponent."
60,Ushiwaka,"The cat said you were a frivolous, lewd, and lustful beast,
but you're a very mature young man."
70,Ushiwaka,"I intended to knock you down in an instant,
since you bored me, but I've reconsidered."
80,Ushiwaka,"I will fight to the end against a worthy foe.
I'll risk my life to take your head."
90,Shiki,... (People from the past sure do think differently!)
