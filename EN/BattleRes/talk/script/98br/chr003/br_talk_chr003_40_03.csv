10,Edmond,...
20,Shiki,"(Huh? He's not moving or speaking... but why?
 Is the silliness of it all overwhelming him?)"
30,Shiki,"(Still, he commands attention just standing there
in the center of the arena... like some sort of conqueror.)"
40,Edmond,"Not at all! I am the avenger of dark grudges!
I never let a smile show, let alone get overwhelmed!"
50,Edmond,"This is me paying respect to distant youth, the end of dreams!
My thanks for the complex emotions over your misfortune!"
60,Shiki,"I-I see. Sorry to disturb you.
Should we begin?"
70,Edmond,...
80,Shiki,I guess not?
90,Edmond,"Where is the True Ancestor Princess?
I caught a glimpse of her earlier."
100,Shiki,"Arcueid? She might have gotten up by now.
Should I call her?"
110,Edmond,... Please.
120,Arcueid,"What's up? Did someone call me?
Hi! Good to meet you, man in black!"
130,Arcueid,"That's a nice coat. You can really tell a lot about both the
person who made it an the person who wears it!"
140,Arcueid,"You appear to be on an endless journey, but fear not,
the person you seek is waiting for you at its end!"
150,Edmond,Heh.
160,Edmond,"Hahaha, ahahahahahahahaha!!
You shall be the one whose journey meets a pleasant end!"
170,Edmond,"Now is the time to prove it! Allow me to show you
a true test of strength!"
180,Shiki,Whoa. He's happy to be mad.
190,Shiki,"But I'm not feeling any negative vibes.
It's strangely refreshing. I guess I should match
his energy and have a good, clean fight!"
