10,Neco_Arc,"Argh, three for three losses. You're quite the protagonist,
enemy of mine."
20,Neco_Arc,"But that all ends here. You've been fighting nonstop,
glasses. You must be exhausted."
30,Neco_Arc,"You've gotta be ready to back down by now.
So, where's the waiting area...?"
40,Ciel,"Oh, by the way. Looking back, which was
the toughest enemy?"
50,Shiki,"That would be Mash. I was surprised how focused
and direct she was."
60,Shiki,"She's a lot like you, and that made for
a very hard fight."
70,Ciel," "
80,Akiha,"How about Ushiwakamaru?
She was faster than you in every way."
90,Shiki,"Yeah, it was hard to catch up with her.
And she hit hard."
100,Shiki,"But little sisters require so much attention.
As an older brother, I'm used to this kind of thing."
110,Akiha, 
120,Arcueid,"For me it was that guy in black!
The way he bounced around felt very familiar."
130,Arcueid,"I'm kind of an avenger, too, you know!
I'm going make you take responsibility for killing him!"
140,Shiki,"Yeah, yeah, sure. Whatever you say.
How about I buy you dinner on the way home?"
150,Neco_Arc,Ugh! Enough pillow talk already! Ick!
160,Neco_Arc,"Then it's time for me to fight! I'll show you real skill
in combat, four-eyes!"
170,Announce,"Upon arriving in this world,
Neco-Arc said$:"
180,Announce,"""Only one can survive. This is a foreordained battle
of Old vs. New."""
190,Announce,"As a knight of the round table,
I would like to see her make good on her resolve."
200,Announce,"This is a battle for this universe,
a truly momentous battle."
210,Announce,And it's the battle we've all been waiting for!
220,Announce,"For all the cats in our audience, it's the showdown you've
been waiting for! The final match!"
230,Shiki,"Are you ready? I have plans after this,
so I'll be ending this quickly."
240,Neco_Arc,"This is what sucks about protagonists with long legs.
You think your reach gives you an advantage?"
250,Neco_Arc,"Well, I guess reach does matter, meow and then.
And since I have no reach, you know it's true coming from me."
260,Neco_Arc,"Still! I'm not the same Neco-Arc I used to be!
I was stuck, unable to learn from anyone strong..."
270,Neco_Arc,"But I've mastered new techniques all my own!
I'm now a shining cat of victory!"
280,Shiki,"What are you talking about? More showy, empty techniques?
Ones that deal almost no damage and don't form any combos?"
290,Neco_Arc,"Nuh-uh! I've succeeded in learning how to walk and
use my beam at the same time!"
300,Neco_Arc,"It can't be Guarded or Shielded.
And it pulls you in! It's a real nightmare."
310,Shiki,Seriously?
320,Neco_Arc,"Mwahaha! Fear my mighty UNBEAM! I'll take you down
with an attack that chips away my own health!"
330,Neco_Arc,"You're not getting help from hacker Kohaku or any cat!
As one of the 27 cats of the new generation,"
340,Neco_Arc,"I'm catcalling myself Lumi-Arc, the brilliant awakening!
This beam will win me a spot on the next cover!"
