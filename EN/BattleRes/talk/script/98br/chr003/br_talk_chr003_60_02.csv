100,Ushiwaka,"You're so light on your feet, Shiki!
You flit around like a feather in the wind!"
110,Ushiwaka,"You could do the moves I do if you tried hard enough.
Why do you not run on walls or cling to ceilings?"
120,Ushiwaka,"Nevertheless, you're nimble because you're frail.
One slip-up could mean falling to your death,
or perhaps that's how you wish to die in battle?"
130,Shiki,"... (People from the past really and truly do think
differently!)"
140,Akiha,"(That said, she's definitely blind to her own shortcomings.
 She's awfully easy to read.)"
150,Akiha,"Miss Ushiwakamaru? Sorry, but could I ask your story?"
160,Akiha,"You said some pretty negative things earlier, like
""I can't choose my master"" and something about ""duty""."
170,Ushiwaka,"To put it simply, I'm a mercenary."
180,Ushiwaka,"That creature summoned me,
so I have to help her."
190,Akiha,"Can't you cancel the arrangement? Oh, you can?
But you need a new master to do it?"
200,Akiha,"Well, that's simple enough. We can easily cover the expenses
for you to live here."
210,Ushiwaka,You want me to betray my master?
220,Akiha,"I'm not asking you to kill her.
I'm just talking about cancelling your arrangement."
230,Akiha,"And there's no need for her to fight against her either.
We can handle that on our own."
240,Ushiwaka,"You are like your brother, Lady Akiha.
I see no reason to refuse your offer under those conditions."
250,Akiha,"Thank you. I think this is the start of
a wonderful friendship."
260,Akiha,"Please, feel free to use the manor all you like.
You're free to do as you please."
270,Ciel,I don't know what to say...
280,Shiki,"Don't say anything, Ciel. Let's just keep our hands
clean as ordinary students."
