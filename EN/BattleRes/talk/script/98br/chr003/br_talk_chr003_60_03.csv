200,Shiki,"Weird... After the fight,
he just suddenly flew off..."
210,Shiki,"Did you know him, Arcueid?
He sure seemed happy to see you."
220,Arcueid,"Huh? He did, didn't he? But no, I didn't recognize him."
230,Arcueid,"He kind of reminded me of you,
with how he endured hardships!"
240,Shiki,"O-Oh, I see. Anyway, I'm glad you're feeling
better again."
250,Shiki,"Next up is the final battle with the cat thing. What do you
want to do? Will you crush her? You're colleagues, right?"
260,Arcueid,...
270,Ciel_and_Akiha,(How should I interpret that expression?)
280,Shiki,"Sorry... I'm really, truly sorry.
I'll never refer to you as colleagues again."
290,Arcueid,"Okay, I forgive you. I don't mind if you go
teach her that lesson, too."
300,Shiki,"Got it. I'll end this quickly.
At the end of the day, she's still just a cat after all."
