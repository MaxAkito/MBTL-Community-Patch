350,Neco_Arc_Rumi,"Impossible... I, Lumi-Arc, crossed countless worlds
to make my way here!"
360,Neco_Arc_Rumi,"How can I lose to mere human emotions?!
Impossible! Unbelievable!"
370,Neco_Arc_Rumi,"I'm down to using my last resort!
I need more power! Hey, Mash!"
380,Neco_Arc_Rumi,"Let me use your shield's power again!
I'll go learn a new trick in the next world over!"
390,Mash,"Huh? But this world was your destination,
Neco-Arc... Wha?"
400,Mash,What is my Round Shield doing?!
410,Neco_Arc_Rumi,"Yes! The heavens favor the righteous!
Now, time for a dive into another world..."
420,Ciel,"That's about what I expected.
Mash said that the shield protects Human Order."
430,Ushiwaka,I see. So she had this coming.
440,Neco_Arc_Rumi,"Arrghh! I can relate to cheese in a grater, now!"
450,Neco_Arc_Rumi,"Ah, augh... So this is the end of my run!
But don't forget me, humanity! Or you either, glasses kid!"
460,Neco_Arc_Rumi,"So long as Tsukihime has multiple endings,
and so long as you don't end up in the true ending...!"
470,Neco_Arc_Rumi,"One version of me or another will be back!
Someday, sometime, I'll be back!"
480,Neco_Arc_Rumi,Continue! Continue! Continue!!
