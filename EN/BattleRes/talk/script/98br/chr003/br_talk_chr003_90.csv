10,KaisetuA,"And so, a week passed by quickly after the battle..."
20,KaisetuA,"All of us at the Tohno manor and the ladies Arcueid
and Ciel came together,"
30,KaisetuA,"and went on various adventures to get Mash
back to her home world, until..."
40,Mash,"I'm sorry to have caused you all so much trouble. The
output from my Noble Phantasm is stable now, thanks to you."
50,Mash,"This gate definitely leads to Chaldea.
Now that I have Edmond Dantes navigation, I'm sure of it!"
60,Edmond,"Don't worry about me. Hurry home, Kyrielight.
There are people waiting for you."
70,Ushiwaka,"I will stay here a while. I was always a Servant
summoned by that cat."
80,Ushiwaka,"Chaldea has its own version of me. It wouldn't be right
for me to tag along."
90,Mash,"I see... That's unfortunate.
I'm sorry to leave you..."
100,Mash,"Thank you all so much, I'm glad I came to Souya.
I'm sure we'll see each other again someday!"
110,KaisetuB,"And so, boundaries were erected to prevent invasions
from other worlds."
120,KaisetuB,"Mash returned to her own world,
and peace returned to the city."
130,KaisetuB,"Thank you for playing and following along
with us so far."
140,KaisetuB,"I, Hisui, the maid at Tohno manor,
have been providing commentary."
150,KaisetuA,"And me, Lady Akiha's faithful retainer, Kohaku!
We're sorry we didn't appear in the story!"
160,KaisetuA,"See you all next time!"
170,KaisetuA,"We hope you continue to enjoy Melty Blood
in the future!"
