10,Noel,"We got something in the mail.
If that little brat kept our promise...then this..."
20,Noel,"No, stop.
I shouldn't get my hopes up..."
30,Noel,"I always get ahead of myself, but
in the end, the best thing it could be is a bonus check."
40,Noel,"Alright.
Time to open it."
50,NONE,"""...per the above report, Executor Noel
 is now relieved of duty as a Burial Agency agent."""
60,NONE,"""Your subsequent orders as a purified local observer
 are to engage in a pilgrimage of almsgiving."""
70,NONE,"""Mario Gallo Bestino,
 Cardinal of the Holy Church"""
80,Noel,Is this for real?
90,Noel,"Whoa, I can't believe how easy that was!
The church already processed the order!"
100,Noel,"A reliable boss is what you need in life, I guess!
I don't like that guy at all, but still!"
110,Noel,"This is the end of that miserable part of my life!
Goodbye, restrictive routines!"
120,Noel,"And hello, normal paychecks!
A normal, stable life is the dream!"
130,Noel,"Hehe...hehehe!
Hehehehehe!"
140,Noel,"Oh, I'm getting too excited.
Stay calm... Relax... I can't stop smiling, though!"
150,Noel,"Hehe, and it's all thanks to that trusting kid. I had planned
on just tossing him aside when I was done with him, too."
160,Noel,"Oh, but I'm giving him too much credit.
He helped a bit, just a tiny bit."
170,Noel,"Anyway, I've got to hurry up and get ready to move!
That cheap apartment is utterly devoid of taste!"
180,Noel,"As a mature woman, I need something gorgeous.
And also casual and cute, and..."
190,Noel,"Hey, stop distracting me, I'm trying to
come up with a perfect (mental) plan!"
200,Noel,"It's a Japanese proverb, even. People who disrupt
daydreamers on the street get hit by cars, and-"
210,Noel,"Oh, so that's how it goes..."
220,Shiki_Hatena,...please!
230,Shiki_Hatena,"Please wake up, Ms. Noel!
Please, wake up or you're going to die!"
240,Noel,Huh?
250,Volv,...!
260,Noel,"Whaaat?! Who's that?
A high-ranking Dead Apostle?! Where the heck am I?!"
270,Noel,"Ahh, it's so hot! The ground is burning!
Someone, explain this! What's going on?!"
280,Shiki_Hatena,"This is... Ms. Noel, did you hit your head?
Oh, it seems she did. She has a bump on the back of it."
290,Shiki_Hatena,"You must have failed to roll after getting hit.
You're very tough, but you're sloppy on the basics.
Please work on that."
300,Noel,Huh? I'm...tough? Very tough?
310,Noel,"Hold on.
I don't care if you're lying, tell me that again!"
320,Shiki_Hatena,"Fine, you're the toughest annoyance in the world.
How many times should I say that?"
330,Shiki_Hatena,"Ms. Noel, you're a vampire-hunting specialist
from a parallel world,"
340,Shiki_Hatena,"and the guardian angel of our city. Plus you have good
business sense. You're the rising star of the Burial Agency."
350,Shiki_Hatena,"You're acting kind of strange,
but then again, you've always been that way."
360,Shiki_Hatena,"Come on, get up.
We're almost there."
370,Shiki_Hatena,"We had him on the ropes before,
so we can win this if we focus."
380,Noel,"W-We did? We can?!
Right, I was sure that was the situation!"
390,Noel,"Alright, I can do this!
Destiny is always in flux! Time for my big turnaround!"
