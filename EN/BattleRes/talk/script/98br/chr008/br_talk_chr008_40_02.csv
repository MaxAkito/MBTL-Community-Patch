10,Noel,"So...basically, long story short..."
20,Noel,"I came to Souya from a parallel world,
and you're a normal person who got caught up with vampires."
30,Noel,"The Dead Apostle just now was friends with the boss
that controls this place,
and we beat him together. Right?"
40,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Putting it broadly, yes."
50,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"You also teach social studies at my school, Ms. Noel.
You're the dance club's advisor,
which just started this year."
60,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"You're the daughter of the CEO of a national cafe chain,
and you have a house in Akayama."
70,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"But you live in a cheap apartment here,
because you don't know anyone in this world."
80,Noel,"(Oh, I get it. This is a parallel world.
　So I've finally been reborn in another life...)"
90,Shiki_GakuseiKare,Ms. Noel?
100,Noel,"No, no, don't worry. It's nothing. I'm fine!
I'm not going to sweat the small stuff!"
110,Noel,"I feel good right now, anyway.
I don't really care that this is a parallel world."
120,Noel,"And you there, in the school uniform.
You're on my side, right?"
130,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Of course. We've been close ever since you saved me
when I was attacked by the dead."
140,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"After you fought them off, the police brought you in
for questioning, and I spoke with them, remember?"
150,Noel,"Seriously?
Oh, right, I remember now."
160,Noel,"""I'm sorry for the trouble with my big sister.
　She had been engaged to a man for 10 years,"
170,Noel,"　until yesterday, when she found out he was
　just catfishing her, and got incredibly drunk..."""
180,Noel,"Was that really the right direction to take?!
The cop was sooo sympathetic! It was kind of awkward!"
190,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"That's good though, he was a good officer.
Souya City is full of empathetic people."
200,Noel,"This is no good!
What's with your attitude?!"
210,Noel,"You're treating me like I'm a child!
And why don't you have glasses on?!"
220,Noel,"And earlier, all you did was stand back and give advice!
A friend would fight with me! Seriously!"
230,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Glasses? Do I normally wear glasses?
I don't think I've ever worn glasses."
240,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"And I took a bad hit to the stomach,
so you told me not to fight, remember?"
250,Noel,"Oh...right, I remember now.
I found you unconscious by the trash collection area, right?"
260,Noel,"You had a bad injury on your stomach,
and I was surprised you were alive..."
270,Noel,Are you better now? Shall we rest a bit more before we go?
280,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Don't worry about me. I was just a bit shocked,
and that put me into a childish mood."
290,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"I haven't lost my memory like you have.
I just can't fight."
300,Noel,"O-Oh, I see.
I sort of had a sense that you were dangerous, that's all..."
310,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Me, dangerous? Not strong or anything like that?
But that's just a vague impression of me, right?"
320,Noel,"Y-Yeah, it is. Really, what was I thinking?
You've helped me out so many times..."
330,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"That's right, I've saved you five times so far,
and you've saved me five times. We're even."
340,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"But that's helped me realize
that I can count on you more than anyone else, Ms. Noel."
350,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"You think you can beat Roa, don't you?
I'm sure you can, Ms. Noel. Definitely."
360,Noel,"Really?
You really think so?"
370,Shiki_GakuseiKare,If you do your best.
380,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"As long as you don't try to climb a pole, slip, and
knock yourself out again, sure you can."
390,Noel,"Ouch, but that does seem like something I'd do!
I really did that, didn't I?"
400,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"So you're starting to remember bits and pieces?
You seem like you'll catch up on this part quickly."
410,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Want to resume the vampire hunt, then?
We already have our mark, after all."
420,Noel,"Yeah, of course!
It all just came back in a flash!"
430,Noel,"There's a rich person's mansion with a view of the city,
a sort of gaudy place for a disagreeable person, right?"
440,Noel,"That's where Roa is hiding!
There's nowhere else as sinister as that place!"
450,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Definitely.
That place is very shady, now that you mention it."
460,Noel,"With that decided, let's get going!
I was turned away before, but you're with me this time!"
470,Noel,"A strong, beautiful woman and her understanding young
friend. It looks like I'm on my heroine's journey!"
480,Negative_Noel,"What?
Where are you getting that from?"
490,Negative_Noel,"You find one nerdy kid and you go crazy?
Or did you get hit by a truck and lose your head or
something?"
500,Negative_Noel,"Just because one or two things go well,
doesn't mean you'll get the outcome you want."
510,Negative_Noel,There's no point in thinking that positively.
520,Negative_Noel,"You'll just end up disappointed in the end,
so it's time to wake up already."
530,Negative_Noel,"Or, no, maybe it's about time I put you to sleep!"
540,Negative_Noel,"Sweet dreams, Noel!
Time to go back down to the dark at the bottom of the well!"
550,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"There's another Ms. Noel here?!
Oh, it's a vampire that mimics its enemy's form!"
560,Noel,"Wait, no, it's not.
It's another me. She's Nega-Noel."
570,Shiki_GakuseiKare,What...?
580,Noel,"Years and years of harsh self-criticism can cause
this sort of issue."
590,Noel,"Does it make more sense if I describe her as my ""evil twin""
that stops me from wholeheartedly doing my best?"
600,Noel,"Oh, I get it! I saw her a few times when I was doing
my makeup. So she has materialized now, huh?"
610,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Alright.
You can tell me more later."
620,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"The problem now is her abilities.
Is Nega-Noel strong?"
630,Noel,"Quite. She's my equal in every way,
except, for some reason, she has infinite Black Keys!"
640,Noel,"It's unfair, isn't it? She really is the ideal executor.
There's no way I could beat that..."
650,Negative_Noel,"You see? I'm enviable, tough, and cool.
Those are the feelings I'm made up of."
660,Negative_Noel,"You have no chance. Just be a good girl,
and sit back and count your mere 10 Black Keys!"
670,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Come on...
That's not the problem."
680,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Ms. Noel's strengths are her simplicity and fast rushes.
You're clumsy, so just focus on one thing at a time."
690,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Her style will be focused strikes.
There's no need to get fancy."
700,Noel,"Thanks, kid."
710,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Generally, just use a single projectile
when you see an opening."
720,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"And really, fighting with a limited supply
is actually cooler and takes more skill."
730,Noel,"You said it! It's not that I only have 10 shots!
It's that I'm so good I only need 10 shots!"
740,Noel,"Here I come, Nega-Noel!
As if your infinite projectiles matter! Hyaaa!"
