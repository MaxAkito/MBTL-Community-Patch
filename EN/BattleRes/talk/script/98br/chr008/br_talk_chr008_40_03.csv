10,Noel,"We're nowhere near being on the same level!
This sucks! My negativity is too strong!"
20,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Now, now. That just means you have room to grow.
You'll get tougher like her eventually, Ms. Noel."
30,Noel,"I-I will?
Thank you for saying that. You're sweet."
40,Noel,"I always thought of you as quiet...or maybe disinterested
in everything, but you're a kind person, deep down."
50,Noel,"If we were in a more casual setting, and I wasn't wearing
my Sister's habit, I just might hit on you!\sf000"
60,Shiki_GakuseiKare,It kind of feels like you already are hitting on me.
70,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Teachers aren't supposed to tell students,
to come wake them up in the morning, are they?"
80,Noel,"Errr... well...
Is that for real?"
90,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"All I do is take the trash out for you.
It couldn't be a healthier relationship."
100,Noel,"O-Of course! You're so much younger, and I'm a teacher,
not to mention a Sister as well! Ugh,
I shouldn't bring my work into this, am I that pathetic?!"
110,Noel,"*Ahem*
Putting that aside for more careful thought later..."
120,Noel,"We're almost to the evil lair now.
The security is insanely tight, as always."
130,Noel,"It doesn't look like it will be easy to sneak in... They'd
just send me away at the gate if I said I had a delivery..."
140,Noel,Do you have any ideas?
150,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Let's get hired as temp cleaners.
I have a reference letter we can use right here."
160,Noel,"Wow, nice!
You can do everything, can't you?!"
170,Noel,"But wait, why do you have that in the first place?
Do you know someone at this mansion?"
180,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Uhh, well, something like that."
190,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"You'll infiltrate as a cleaner, Ms. Noel,
so try to investigate without blowing your cover."
200,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"We still don't know who the vampire is,
so let's gather evidence before we fight anyone."
210,Noel,"I know! Leave it to me!
And anyway, harming the general public is prohibited!"
220,Noel,"So, I'll just ring the doorbell, and--"
230,Hisui,"There is no need for that.
I've been listening to your conversation."
240,Hisui,"You saw we were hiring staff, I take it.
We have a chronic staffing shortage. We need the help."
250,Hisui,"Also, if Shi--"
260,Shiki_GakuseiKare,...
270,Hisui,"If he is your reference, we won't need a background check.
However..."
280,Hisui,"There are a few vital points to know when working here,
even as an ordinary temp."
290,Hisui,"The estate is quite spacious, as you can see,
so there is a risk of attacks by wild bears."
300,Hisui,"Karate, Jiu-jitsu, Aikido, Capoeira, Pencak silat,
Sambo, Mambo...Excuse me, that last one was a mistake."
310,Hisui,"As head maid of the Tohno residence, I, Hisui,
will test your skills here and now."
320,Noel,"That's fine, but serious question, how can a mansion
have issues with sudden bear attacks?!"
