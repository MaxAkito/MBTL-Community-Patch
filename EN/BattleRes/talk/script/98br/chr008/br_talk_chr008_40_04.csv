10,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"So we successfully got hired as servants.
And here we are! A new servant and a new butler."
20,Noel,"Indeed!
I'm just better at infiltration than combat!"
30,Noel,"The interview was easy too.
That maid was the sweet, honest type, wasn't she?"
50,Noel,"Anyway, now for the real challenge.
We've got to look for anything suspicious as we do our jobs."
60,Noel,"Stay sharp. This is the enemy's home turf.
The game's up if anyone finds out we're hunting a vampire."
70,Noel,"We need to stay aware of each other at all times,
and get in touch the moment we sense danger."
80,Noel,"If you get an SOS from me, make that your top priority.
Make sure you rush in and save me right away!"
90,Noel,"I hate mansions, they remind me of horror movies!
There's always a vampire living in them!"
100,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Yeah, definitely.
This place has a strong horror movie vibe."
110,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"I'll go check out the second floor of the west wing, then.
You take the first floor, Ms. Noel."
120,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Oh, and we should avoid the east wing.
Let's stick to the west for today."
130,Noel,"Got it!
We'll take on the east wing tomorrow!"
140,Noel,"I'm exhausted.
I'm gonna have some pudding."
150,Noel,"This mansion really is way too big.
And only four people live in it according to the maid!"
160,Noel,"I had to clean a room no one has entered for half a year
as my first job. How inconsiderate is that?"
170,Noel,"On the other hand, getting free use of the kitchen
has its appeal. Let's see what's in the fridge..."
180,Noel,"Oh, nice! Look at all these fancy-looking sweets!
They've got everything, both Japanese and western!"
190,Noel,"So dessert's settled...
But I want something that will keep me going."
200,Noel,"Pasta (high-grade), bacon (finest cut), onion (organic),
garlic (specialty), milk and cheese (farm-fresh), and..."
210,Noel,"Hehehe, this is gonna be amazing!"
220,Noel,"Put the pasta in the container, add a little salt,
microwave it, and it's a double KO!"
230,Noel,I don't have enough time to sit and boil it.
240,Noel,"I have two jobs already, as an executor and teacher.
You can't expect much more from me."
250,Noel,"Then I throw the fine ingredients into a frying pan,
and I have a simple carbonar--"
260,Kohaku,"That's so fattening!
What in God's good name are you doing?!"
270,Noel,"Eek!
Whoa! Wait, was that a Japanese sword?!
Are you another crazy servant?!"
280,Kohaku,"No. I have the third best common sense of anyone in the
Tohno household. I am the bright and sunny maid Kohaku."
290,Kohaku,"You must be the new servant, then.
That means you passed the interview..."
300,Kohaku,"Then you must know the shame of a dedicated servant
using a microwave to cut corners!"
310,Kohaku,"Even if you can deceive sweet, trusting Hisui,
you can't deceive my eyes."
320,Kohaku,"I won't stand aside as some stranger
is entrusted with the kitchen of the Tohno home,"
330,Kohaku,"or the wellbeing of the eldest Tohno son.
I must ask you to leave. To begin with--"
340,Kohaku,"Want some carbonara for lunch? All the girls
with office jobs love pasta and a salad for lunch."
350,Noel,"Oh but we're all lying to ourselves.
Whether or not you have a salad, pasta is pasta."
360,Noel,"You're still going to gain weight if that's your lunch.
There's no way to eat that way and still lose weight."
370,Noel,"You really need to focus on releasing stress and exercise.
In the end, it's mental strength that gets you ahead in life."
380,Kohaku,"Hmm. I thought perhaps we might find some common ground,
but it seems that isn't always possible."
390,Kohaku,"As a small mercy, I'll at least prepare the house special
for you first."
400,Kohaku,"It's made with all-natural, illegally grown, organic veggies.
Please enjoy your meal!\sf000"
