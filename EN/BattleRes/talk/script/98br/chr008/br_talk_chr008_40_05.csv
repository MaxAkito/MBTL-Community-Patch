10,Noel,"That was close...!
What was wrong with that maid?! Or this whole house?!"
20,Noel,"And that boy didn't show up even though I sent an SOS!
I managed to drive her off somehow, but still!"
30,Noel,"That said, this basically confirms what we suspected.
Steely maids and smiley domestic servants..."
40,Noel,"There is definitely a vampire hiding here.
It would actually be scarier if there wasn't."
50,Noel,"And geez... There were veggies all the way to
the edge of the screen!
I've had enough salad for a while, that's for sure..."
60,Akiha,"You're quite sensitive for a rat that sneaks into people's
homes. I guess I do feel sorry for you a little, though."
70,Akiha,"I assume Kohaku was a difficult opponent for you.
I can tell at a glance that you're a disposable pawn."
80,Noel,"What?! When did she...?!
And why is she looking down on me?! She's a child!"
90,Akiha,"I apologize for staying up here. I am not accustomed to
lowering myself to stand with lower people."
100,Akiha,"So, who do you work for?"
110,Akiha,"If you tell me your affiliation and objective,
I might almost welcome you as a guest."
120,Noel,"Hah! You think I'd want to be welcomed by a vampire,
even for ten times my salary?! You really are an idiot!"
130,Noel,"Akiha Tohno, you are clearly the Dead Apostle's new host!
Time to shift into Burial Agent mode and finish you off!"
140,Akiha,"Dead Apostles...and the Burial Agency...?
I haven't seen anyone like you before."
150,Akiha,"Perhaps we've both been mistaken.
Shall we talk a bit more?"
160,Akiha,"...so you thought that this vampire named Roa
had moved to this house. I see..."
170,Akiha,"You said your name was Noel?
Assuming I believe all of your story..."
180,Akiha,"I apologize for saying this,
but don't you think you need to investigate a little more?"
190,Noel,"Huh? No way!
I've investigated thoroughly for over a month!"
200,Akiha,"In that case, let's go over each point one by one."
210,Akiha,"These Dead Apostle creatures cannot survive in the sunlight.
But no one has spotted any such people at the
Tohno household."
220,Noel,"Well...there could be tricks involved,
or there's some really strong Japanese sunscreen..."
230,Akiha,"Second, while the eldest son here is definitely
a troublemaker, he has a shockingly weak constitution..."
240,Akiha,"He's like a lemming, ready to die the moment you look away.
Do you think someone like that could pose a threat
to the city?"
250,Noel,"Well...he might be a weak body to move into...
the vampire might even die immediately."
260,Akiha,"And third, assuming the vampire had moved into me,
this city would be gone already."
270,Akiha,"I certainly wouldn't waste whole years subjugating people.
Do you see what I'm getting at?"
280,Noel,"R-Really?
Haha...ahahahaha... You're serious, then."
290,Akiha,"To begin with, these Dead Apostles you speak of?
You say they drink human blood, but why?"
300,Noel,"They get nutrients from it,
and I guess to gain magi- er, to gain power?"
310,Noel,"Anyway, they feed on people to get stronger!
They're cheating!
It's like they get to stock up on extra lives."
320,Akiha,"Hm...
So they go to the trouble of drinking blood just for that?"
330,Noel,Huh?
340,Akiha,"These western monsters sure have inconvenient habits.
They have to do a lot by hand."
350,Noel,"(Oh, this girl is different. She's not a vampire.
 She's another kind of monster!)"
360,Noel,"I'm sorry, this was all my misunderstanding!
I'll see myself out, right away!"
370,Noel,"One of my superiors will come by to apologize later.
We can discuss it and you can attack us then!"
380,Akiha,"Oh? You're leaving so soon?
We've resolved our little misunderstanding,
so I hoped you would stay for dinner."
390,Akiha,"I don't get to know other people very often.
Please take care."
400,Noel,"Of course!
I'll be on my way before I start any more fires!"
410,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Oh, Ms. Noel. Are you headed home already?"
420,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"I'll go with you.
I mean, you don't have your apartment keys, do you?"
430,Akiha,"Hehehe.
Has she drafted her will already, I wonder?"
440,Noel,She certainly seems to have started a major fire at least!
