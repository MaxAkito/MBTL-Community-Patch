10,Noel,"Somehow we made it out alive! *sob*
I never want to see another mansion again!"
20,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"What a mess. I thought the dog might like you at least.
That was foolish of me."
30,Noel,"And you! I sent you an SOS text,
and you didn't show up! What were you doing?!"
40,Shiki_GakuseiKare,Oh. You did. I do have a new text.
50,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Sorry. I was organizing the library with the maid,
and I must have missed it."
60,Noel,"How can you be so cool about it?!
You're secretly a monster, aren't you?!"
70,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Am I? I'm sorry. Honestly,
I'm just not used to dealing with other people."
80,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"I grew up in a small town in the country.
I didn't really have friends my age."
90,Noel,"Really? You seemed so sociable.
Are you pushing yourself to help me out?"
100,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"I'm not doing it out of concern for you.
We both saw each other at our worst, right?"
110,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"But more importantly, what are we going to do now?
What's your objective, Ms. Noel?"
120,Noel,"Hmm. Well, since the mansion on the hill wasn't the place,
we should check the school next, I suppose."
130,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Not that, I meant what do you want to do next,
after you beat the vampire we're hunting?"
140,Noel,"You mean... as in my future plans, or my dreams?
Do you think I have those? Me?"
150,Noel,"I don't have time to think of stuff like that!
I have lots of hopes, but they'll never come true!"
160,Noel,"My life has negative value! That ship has sunk!
I'll never rise to anything until I beat that vampire!"
170,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"You're currently sinking deeper and deeper into the sea.
Clearly, just living takes all you have."
180,Shiki_GakuseiKare,Oops.
190,Roa,...
200,Noel,"(Whoa, his eyes are crazy!
Å@He's as white as a ghost! Is he on something?!)"
210,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"I'm sorry. I got so absorbed in the conversation,
I wasn't watching where I was going."
220,Roa,"No, it's fine.
We just bumped shoulders."
230,Roa,"That said, I can see your guard was down,
especially since you're out with your lovely girlfriend."
240,Roa,"Parks bring out the feral part of people at night.
Try to be careful in the future."
250,Noel,"(Despite how he looks, he's a nice guy!
Å@I shouldn't discount Souya just yet!)"
260,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"We will. Oh, and you too.
Your shirt's missing a button."
270,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Are you in a rock band or something?
You look like you just finished performing or something."
280,Noel,"Oh, you're right.
Don't worry. All the cool pianists show a little skin!"
290,Roa,What'd you say?!
300,Roa,"Wouldn't it make more sense for me to be a rock guitarist?
Who ever heard of a pianist in leather pants?"
310,Roa,To hell with this! I'm going feral!
320,Roa,"I wanted the first track to be a gentle ballad,
but we're going up-tempo out of the gate!"
330,Roa,"The sensitive mindset of a performer!
I'll beat some proper music appreciation into you both!"
340,Noel,"Whoa! I was complimenting you!
He's so fast!"
350,Noel,"Wow, I read a book once where the city center was full of
super-tough cyborgs, I had no idea it was non-fiction!"
