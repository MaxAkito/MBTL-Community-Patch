10,Noel,"He was like a wild horse out of control...
Really a suspicious person... but I won in any case."
20,Noel,"What was with that guy?
No normal person is that fast- Eep?!"
30,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"He turned to dust. Look at the embroidery on
the back of his shirt. It says ""M. ROA. V."""
40,Noel,What did you say?!
50,Shiki_GakuseiKare,Congrats on beating your arch-nemesis.
60,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"It's more of a punchline than a proper ending,
but I guess all's well that ends well."
70,Noel,"Well, yes...but...
I guess I did succeed in beating Roa..."
80,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"You can finally move on now.
So, as you were saying...?"
90,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"You have lots of hopes and dreams for the future, right?
Now you're free to pursue them."
100,Noel,"No, no, I'm not.
I can't. I'm not happy at all right now."
110,Noel,"Is it really over?
Is this really my happy ending?"
120,Noel,"Something is missing, or something is wrong somehow..."
130,Noel,"I suddenly find myself fighting a high-level
Dead Apostle I could never beat,"
140,Noel,"and you're there to help me be strong through it,
then everything goes right somehow..."
150,Noel,It's almost like I'm the main character or something...
160,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"What's wrong with that?
Isn't that a good thing, Ms. Noel?"
170,Noel,"I am happy it turned out that way.
I am, but something is missing."
180,Noel,"If this is my story,
then the main boss at the end should be..."
190,Noel,Her! Yeah! That arrogant brunette!
200,Noel,"Even if I'm the center of a world,
it doesn't mean anything if she's not around to see it!"
210,Noel,None of it means anything!
220,Shiki_GakuseiKare,So?
230,Noel,This is all fake!
240,Noel,"Even if I have a better life here, and I'm happy,
and I have a boyfriend like you!"
250,Noel,"It's all wrong!
This isn't my world!"
260,Noel,"And for all that I worked hard, I never
wanted to become the heroine in the first place!"
270,Noel,"Oh, well, I still want to be the heroine if I can!
But that's not the point!"
280,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"You're sounding a little mixed up.
I'm not sure what you're trying to say."
290,Noel,"It's not about the logic, this is about my feelings!
Understand?!"
300,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Oh, geez.
I guess there's no avoiding a battle here."
310,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"I'm your collaborator here, Ms. Noel,
in your goal to find a happy ending in this world."
320,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"If you're going to get in the way of that
even if it's you yourself, I still have to kill you."
330,Noel,"...!
He showed his true colors!"
340,Noel,"I kind of sensed it from the start, though.
Ever since I got here, he's been the most suspicious!"
350,Noel,"I'll show you who's the disappointed one here!
You've blown your chance to be with a beautiful older woman!"
