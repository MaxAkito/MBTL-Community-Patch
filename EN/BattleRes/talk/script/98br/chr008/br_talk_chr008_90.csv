10,Noel,"I won!
I won, but..."
20,Noel,"The world is fading to white!
I think I'm going back to my original world!"
30,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Yes, you're heading back.
After all, you just rejected this world, didn't you?"
40,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"You won fairly. All the more by just happening upon
your arch-nemesis and finding out he was a brute."
50,Noel,That's true...but what about you?
60,Noel,"I'm glad I had you around to help me, but
what happens to you now? Do you only exist here?"
70,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"No, I don't exist in either world.
I'll vanish when you wake up, Ms. Noel."
80,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"I'm, well..."
90,Shiki_Yakusoku,"It's time to open your eyes, princess.
This is our concert venue tonight."
100,Arcueid,A second back-alley date?!
110,Arcueid,"You idiot, don't talk to me! I'm going home! I'll forgive you
if you come up with something better by tomorrow!"
120,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Due to extenuating circumstances, I had dropped my glasses,
and my memory went blank for a bit from the shock."
130,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"But don't worry, I have no one to blame but myself.
No matter how you look at it, I was a rare occurrence."
140,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"I'll just vanish like I was never here
when you wake up."
150,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"But I really did hunt vampires with
you, Ms. Noel."
160,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Although, I did wonder if this was the right way
to go about it."
170,Noel,"So...
You knew it would end up like this?"
180,Noel,"You knew, and you still helped me?
Even though I might be dead already?"
190,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"You have a future, unlike me."
200,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"It was fun, mostly.
Being your pretend boyfriend for a while wasn't so bad."
210,Noel,Ahh...
220,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Well, thank you for everything.
Now you're the heroine, right?"
230,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"You still don't really look the part,
but do your best whenever you can."
240,Noel,"Oh, wait...
Why didn't I start from there? It's so obvious."
250,Noel,"Hey! What's your name, anyway?!
Tell me your name, before we go!"
260,Shiki_GakuseiKare,"Nah.
That would just ruin the mood."
270,Noel,"Huh? But I want to know!
What's your email address?"
280,Noel,Wha...? It was a dream?!
290,Noel,"Yup... I'm back to my normal life.
My boring old life where nothing ever changes."
300,Noel,"I felt like I was coming down with a cold yesterday.
I was so tired I don't even remember when I went to bed."
310,Noel,"I feel awful, my head hurts...
And I have no one to help me."
320,Noel,"Am I going to have to contact Ciel? Damn it!
Or I'll get better on my own, as usual, and--"
330,Shiki,"Huh? Ms. Noel, you're awake?
I'll make you breakfast, then."
340,Shiki,"I only know how to make rice porridge,
but that's a good food for sick people."
350,Noel,Huh?
360,Noel,"Shiki, why are you here?
Oh, am I dreaming? Again?!"
370,Shiki,"What do you mean? You texted me last night.
""I'm sic. So sleppy. Plz bring pudding and sports drink."""
380,Shiki,"I couldn't just ignore a request like that,
so I came to take care of you. Was that bad?"
390,Noel,"N-No, not at all...
But you're Shiki Tohno, right? The one I was investigating?!"
400,Shiki,When was that?
410,Shiki,"It's true, you did pick fights with me
when we first met, but..."
420,Shiki,"a lot of things happened, and you needed help,
so eventually I just gave in."
430,Noel,"...
You gave in, meaning...?"
440,Shiki,"You caught me, I guess?
I've had the key to your place for seven days."
450,Noel,"I thought I dreamed that, but it was real?!
No way, this is the perfect ending for me!"
460,Noel,"I thought I got hit by a truck,
but I didn't!"
470,Shiki,"(You almost did, though.
Å@This all started when I saved you from that.)"
480,Noel,"You see this, Ciel?! I came from behind to get the win!
My life is going to be perfect from here on!"
490,Noel,"Ahh, wonderful!
What a glorious ending!"
500,Arcueid_with_Ciel_and_Akiha,"So this is that Noel woman's house.
Well, let's head in!"
510,Ciel_with_Arcueid_and_Akiha,"Indeed.
I want to hear Sister Noel's explanation."
520,Akiha_with_Arcueid_and_Ciel,"As the head of the household, I want to hear my brother's.
I can hardly imagine what they'll say!\sf000"
530,NONE,What will Noel's fate be...?
