10,Shiki,Okay...
20,Shiki,"I heard a strange noise,
but now that I've come to check it out..."
30,Shiki,"There's no dog barking or a shadow
to be seen. That's a relief!"
40,Neco_Arc_Hatena,"How about instead of a dog barking,
it was a cat meowing?"
50,Neco_Arc,"Me, specifically. Hey there.
Isn't the moon pretty tonight?"
60,Shiki,Huh?! You're...
70,Neco_Arc_Rumi,"Augh... So this is the end of my time here!
But don't forget me, humanity! Or you, glasses kid!"
80,Neco_Arc_Rumi,"One version of me or another will be back!
Someday, sometime, I'll be back!"
90,Shiki,You're back already?!
100,Neco_Arc,"Oh, you know how it is!Åô It's all about supply and demand.
I can start a sequel within two minutes at max."
110,Neco_Arc,"I was only here for special content before anyway.
And I was only at 200% of my real strength."
120,Neco_Arc,"You're smart; you get that it was an odd episode
for one of a cat's nine title releases, right?"
130,Neco_Arc,"But now I'm being serious. This is a main story update...
the end for the MB universe."
140,Neco_Arc,"Oh, and by a cat's nine title releases, I mean my parts
in the start, middle, and end of each of the games."
150,Shiki,...
160,Neco_Arc,"Hey, are just going to silently use your killer vision?
You really underestimate me."
170,Neco_Arc,"You idiot! I lost on purpose in that hypothetical battle
last time!"
180,Neco_Arc,"Those girls would've beaten me senseless
if I screwed up and took you down!"
190,Neco_Arc,"But you're alone now! Your habit of heading out to see what's
happening on your own has come back to bite you in the butt!"
