10,Miyako,"Zzz... Zzz... Stop throwing things...
Please... I'll beat you up if you don't..."
20,Miyako,"No... I'll do it tomorrow,
so today just let me... Huh?"
30,Miyako,Was there a flash of light just now?
40,Miyako,"It was very close...
Or, it was right beside me, I think?"
50,Miyako,...
60,Miyako,"Whoa! What is this?!
It's a statue of Shiki!"
70,Miyako,"No, wait, it's a figurine?
I'll call it a statue anyway!"
80,Miyako,"It's so cool and realistic!
It looks just like him!"
90,Miyako,"But why's it here?
I ask as if it isn't obvious!"
100,Miyako,"This has to be a present
from my father! Clearly!"
110,Miyako,"He bought it to cheer me up,
since Shiki went to the Tohno manor!"
120,Miyako,"Alright, I feel better! Here's to Miyako Arima,
starting the day at six!"
130,Miyako,"First I need to clean the dojo floors, then work out,
then it's 100 reps on today's lesson!"
140,Miyako,"I'll make it look good, too, so keep an eye on me, Shiki
Statue! I'm so much tougher now!"
150,Miyako,Alright! Finished with kung fu ten minutes early!
160,Miyako,"*ahem* This is all thanks to you, Shiki Statue."
170,Miyako,...
180,Miyako,"So, yeah. I've been working hard today,
even though it's Sunday..."
190,Miyako,"Do you think...
I could get a kiss as a reward?!"
200,Miyako, 
210,Neco_Arc,...
220,Miyako,Did you see that?!
230,Neco_Arc,"Nope, I didn't see anything.
You haven't done it yet."
240,Neco_Arc,"You can't fire off any beams
if you don't have the guts to kiss even a doll."
250,Neco_Arc,"Keep going. Don't worry about me,
go right ahead and get all hot and sweaty."
260,Neco_Arc,You really don't need to be shy.
270,Miyako, 
280,Miyako,"Ahhhh!
Bad cat! I'll get you!"
