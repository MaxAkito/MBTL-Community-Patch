10,Shiki,...and that about covers what happened last night.
20,Shiki,"I got hit by that cat's weird beam,
and split into 17 copies or whatever."
30,Miyako,"What a terrible, terrible cat!
I'll launch her all the way to Venus next time!"
40,Miyako,"Oh! S-Sorry, I wasn't thinking!"
50,Shiki,"It's alright, it was an accident.
I know you won't go wild all of a sudden."
60,Shiki,"This is where I was headed.
Thank you for bringing me this far."
70,Shiki,"You should get home soon,
so Keiko doesn't worry."
80,Miyako,"But... Shiki, where are you going?
You're still small."
90,Shiki,"I don't get how it works, but since I've been split,
I need to find the rest of me, right?"
100,Shiki,"It seems like I'm the only one of me that can move.
I'll figure it out somehow."
110,Miyako,"(Oh, no... I can't let him go alone!
 Not after he finally came home...)"
120,Miyako,"(No, no, coming home isn't the point!
 I can't leave him alone right now!)"
130,Miyako,"W-Wait, Shiki!
P-Please, let me help, too!"
140,Miyako,"It's kind of my fault too
that the bad cat did all this!"
150,Miyako,"And it's not a school day, so if I just go home,
I'll go stir-crazy and probably get in trouble!"
160,Shiki,...
170,Shiki,"Okay. That would be encouraging.
You'd be a big asset to have helping me, Miyako."
180,Shiki,"Can I ask you to help me search for the other
versions of me, then?"
190,Miyako, 
200,Miyako,"Yeah, of course! Don't worry, Shiki,
you're not alone anymore!"
210,Shiki,"(She's so cute when she smiles. I'll do my best
 not to let her take me anywhere dangerous.)"
220,Shiki,Great. But we have to be careful about this.
230,Shiki,"How should we go about this?
Should I follow you, so you don't step on me?"
240,Miyako,"You should ride in my bag!
I'll ask you for help if there's any trouble!"
250,Shiki,I guess that's our only option...
260,Shiki,"Even if it's not a school day, I don't feel great
asking you to run around alone, Miyako..."
270,Miyako,"I'm not alone, though.
You're with me, Shiki."
280,Shiki,"(I'm happy to hear her say that, but at a glance she's still
 an elementary school kid out on her own...)"
290,Shiki,"Alright. I'll come right out if anything happens,
so tell me if you see anyone dangerous-looking."
300,Miyako,Got it!
310,Miyako,"Oh, and can I ask you something?
How big are you now, Shiki?"
320,Shiki,"Well, I was split into 17 copies. I'm a little over
170 centimeters tall, so divide that by 17..."
330,Miyako,So 10 centimeters! I-I'll be careful with you!
340,Miyako,"But why were you split into 17 copies?
Was there any reason for that?"
350,Shiki,...
360,Shiki,"By the way, Miyako?"
370,Shiki,"I have an idea of where another me is.
Let's head there first."
380,Shiki,"(If that cat was telling the truth...
 Then there's probably another one there.)"
390,Miyako,"I came to the field on the plateau
like you said, but..."
400,Miyako,"Oh, wait, over there! That's you, Shiki!"
410,Shiki,"Miyako, be careful! Above you!
Something's flying this way!"
420,Miyako,I see it! It's fast!
430,Miyako,"Did you see what a good team we make?! Come out,
whoever you are! We know you're friends with that bad cat!"
440,Ciel,"I should compliment you on blocking my Black Key.
But your lies won't fool me."
450,Ciel,"The fact that you've come searching for the 17 statues of
Shiki is proof that you work for that cat."
460,Ciel,"I will be taking this statue and the one
that you're holding."
470,Ciel,"I don't enjoy threatening a little girl,
but I should be the one to save him."
480,Miyako,"Whoa, she's a tough-looking Sister!
Wh-What do I do, Shiki?!"
490,Miyako,"Do you know her?
If you do, can we talk it out?!"
500,Shiki,"Huh? No, I don't know her.
I doubt talking will be any help."
510,Ciel,"(Is that a real-live Shiki?!
 And he doesn't know me?!)"
