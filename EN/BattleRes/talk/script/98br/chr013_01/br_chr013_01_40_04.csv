10,Arcueid,"Did you call for me, Ciel?
I know the deal with rooftop meetings!"
20,Arcueid,"They're the perfect places
for sneaky traps and ambushes!"
30,Arcueid,"But I'm in just the best mood today,
so I'm walking right into it just for you!"
40,Akiha,"So...not just me,
but also Arcueid?"
50,Akiha,"I thought she was finally ready to settle things,
but it seems there's another reason for this."
60,Ciel,"Yes. First, I'd like to introduce you to someone.
Go ahead, Miyako."
70,Miyako,"N-Nice to meet you!
I'm Miyako Arima!"
80,Miyako,"My dream is to become a bajiquan master
and open a dojo with Shiki!"
90,Arcueid,"Oh, hello!
I'm Arcueid Brunestud!"
100,Arcueid,"I don't really have any dreams,
but my job was being a princess!"
110,Miyako,"(A princess! Oh wow, a real princess!
 She's so pretty and feminine!)"
120,Akiha,"You said your name was Arima?
Wait. So you're the daughter of the Arima family?"
130,Akiha,"Please excuse my rudeness. I am Akiha Tohno.
If you're an Arima, you must recognize that name?"
140,Miyako,"(She's a queen! She's so pretty,
 but haughty!)"
150,Ciel,"You shouldn't intimidate a little girl when you've only
just met her."
160,Ciel,"These two won't listen to me for some reason,
so you tell them, Miyako."
170,Ciel,"Or actually... why don't you tell them, Shiki,
as Miyako's guardian?"
180,Miyako,"Huh?! Sister, isn't that a secret?!"
190,Arcueid,"Huh? Shiki's here? Where?!
I had something to talk to him about, so yay!"
200,Akiha,"Where is my brother? He stayed out without telling anyone
last night, and I still haven't heard from him..."
210,Miyako,"Er, well, um... He's..."
220,Shiki,(I guess I have no choice...)
230,Shiki,"(Arcueid... I can't look at her. She's so pretty it will
 throw me off, even in this condition.)"
240,Shiki,"(The real problem is the other girl... Is that really Akiha?
 She's changed so much... or maybe not.)"
250,Shiki,(She was always beautiful.)
260,Shiki,"I'm right here. Hello. Not sure if I should say nice to meet
you or long time no see."
270,Arcueid,"Whoa, a tiny Shiki?!
Ohh... Oh wow... Whoa!"
280,Akiha,"...
(*Shutdown due to overload)"
290,Shiki,(That was the reaction I expected... I guess it's natural.)
300,Shiki,"Um, Arcueid? I'm sorry, it seems like we know
each other."
310,Shiki,"But for me, this is my first time meeting you. So this
will seem like I'm explaining for someone else, but..."
320,Arcueid,"Huh? We're meeting for the first time, you and me?"
330,Arcueid,"That's totally absurd! There are things you're not supposed
to joke about, you know?!"
340,Arcueid,"Oh, I get it. Ciel brainwashed you again.
I just have to fix you... physically."
350,Arcueid,"This will hurt, so brace yourself!
I'll wring you out like a wet rag!"
360,Shiki,"Whoa! No need to be that rough!
What's with the crazy princess?!"
370,Miyako,"W-W-Wait! You have to be careful with him
right now!"
