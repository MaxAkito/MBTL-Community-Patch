10,Shiki,"Wait. Miyako, could you go down that alley?"
20,Akiha,"Shiki, we shouldn't take detours--"
30,Miyako,"Okay! This way, right, Shiki?"
40,Akiha,...
50,Noel,"Hey, what even...
Hey, it was around here last night!"
60,Noel,"Did someone get here before me?
But who would come to this neighborhood?"
70,Noel,"Ahh, I messed up...
I should've grabbed it when I saw it..."
80,Noel,"But, even so... hee hee. It's about doing the right thing,
one day at a time."
90,Noel,"Right, Shiki? How often do you get chances like this?"
100,Noel,Or is this punishment for being popular for so long?
110,Noel,"You can't move, you're palm-sized, and you get treated
like a doll... You must be miserable!\sf000"
120,Noel,"""Anyone with the potential for a romance route gets one.""
""The one who finds the most will be the next main heroine!"""
130,Noel,"That cat is creepy, but she has smart ideas!"
140,Noel,"This gives even me a shot at a win!Åô
Time to grab them all and get my heroine route!"
150,Noel,"Ehehe! Just hold on, Shiki! I'll make you
into my ideal man!\sf000"
160,Miyako,You big creep!
170,Noel,"Wha?! Ciel?! No, wait..."
180,Noel,"You're just some kid. Don't startle me like that.
I'm busy, go play somewhere el--"
190,Akiha,"Excuse me. Could you show me what you
have in your hand there?"
200,Noel,Huh?! Akiha Tohno?! Oh no... Agh?!
210,Akiha,"Miyako, I'll make sure she can't get away.
You get the statue from her."
220,Akiha,"I don't know who you are, or why you're here, but--"
230,Akiha,"(I really have to make him think about how casually
 he connects with just anyone.)"
240,Akiha,Let's make sure she needs a feeding tube after this.
250,Miyako,Y-Yes ma'am! Got it!
260,Noel,"No, wait, hold on! I'll give it to you! Have mercy!"
270,Akiha,"You seem to be confused. The statue was always our
secondary objective."
280,Akiha,"The fact that you have a romantic connection to the Tohno heir
or even the potential for one is unacceptable to me."
290,Akiha,"Elder brothers place their little sisters first.
I won't allow you to disrupt that universal constant."
300,Noel,"Argh, fake crying won't work on her issues!
So I'm down to my final trump card..."
310,Noel,"Don't underestimate me, I'm older than you!
I've been through it all before!"
320,Dead_Noel,"Here I am! The ultimate beauty!
Am I the youngest one here now?"
330,Dead_Noel,"You all look like hags next to me. Hags.
You're all just collecting dust."
340,Dead_Noel,"You agree, right, Shiki? You like younger women,
don't you?"
350,Dead_Noel,"Just kidding, I know you like both!"
360,Dead_Noel,"Now watch this. I'm not just cutest, I'm also strong enough
to take out everyone older than me!"
370,Miyako,"That's odd. She was about 27, and now she's my age."
380,Miyako,"But now that we're the same age, we can be friends!
Hello! I'm Miyako Arima!"
390,Dead_Noel,...
400,Dead_Noel,"Oh, come on! Even when the genre shifts,
I still have to deal with rivals?!"
