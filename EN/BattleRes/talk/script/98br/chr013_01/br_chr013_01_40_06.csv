10,Akiha,"...and that's everything. Does the situation
make sense now?"
20,Hisui,...
30,Kohaku,...
40,Akiha,"The crystal statues that appeared in your rooms this
morning are part of a family treasure split into 17 pieces."
50,Akiha,"I've entrusted the one I had to Miyako.
Please give her yours, as well."
60,Akiha,"Well, that's what I would like, at least.
I won't force you."
70,Akiha,"The statues aren't just decorations; they have meaning.
I mustn't simply seize them from you."
80,Akiha,"So, if you do not wish to surrender yours, you will
have to face Miyako here."
90,Akiha,"Seize your destiny yourself, or let it go.
That's the way love is, isn't it?"
100,Hisui,Mistress Akiha... may I?
110,Kohaku,Of course! What a moving and magnanimous speech!
120,Kohaku,"As I expect of Mistress Akiha, the first lady of the
Tohno family! You shine like a star!"
130,Hisui,I understand.
140,Hisui,"When you brought Mistress Miyako here, Mistress Akiha,
I was prepared to hand over this statue..."
150,Hisui,"But... now I will fight my hardest. This is my true,
forbidden magical jade power."
160,Miyako,"(This maid is acting really serious!
I've got to fight my best, too!)"
170,Miyako,"Yes, ma'am! Thank you for the chance to spar!
We're both worried about Shiki, I can tell!"
