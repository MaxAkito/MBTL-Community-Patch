10,Hisui,"That's enough fighting for now.
You really do attack from the heart, don't you?"
20,Hisui,"Here you are. Thank you for facing me
in an all-out match."
30,Miyako,"Thank you, as well!
I'll be sure to restore Shiki to normal!"
40,Kohaku,"Good fight, Hisui.
That means I'm up next!"
50,Kohaku,"I'm no fighter, but if it's for Shiki,
I will face you as a fully vitamin-packed Kohaku!"
60,Hisui,"Don't lean into that too much, Kohaku.
Mistress Miyako is fighting for Shiki, too."
70,Kohaku,"Oh, that's right. Hmm. So, basically it doesn't matter
either way who wins this fight?"
80,Kohaku,"Shiki is restored if Mistress Miyako wins.
And we wouldn't misuse the statues if we won, so..."
90,Akiha,"Kohaku, please."
100,Kohaku,"I'm sorry, let's just fight! I can't allow for Mistress
Akiha's feelings to go to waste!Åô"
110,Kohaku,Calling this a fight for Shiki would be far too forward...
120,Kohaku,"It would be like cheating on a diet,
it betrays the spirit of a good maid..."
130,Kohaku,"So... while this may be bold of me, I will fight
as another potential heroine!"
140,Kohaku,"Are you ready, Mistress Miyako? My broom's sharpness
is at five star levels today!"
