10,Arcueid,"Nope, no good. I can't get through that door."
20,Miyako,A-Are you feeling ill?! I'll go get you medicine!
30,Arcueid,"No, it's not that. I just have this feeling. Like I'll
definitely regret it if I go through."
40,Arcueid,"It sucks that I can't go with you,
but I'll wait for you and Shiki here."
50,Arcueid,"Ciel, keep it together for them. I know how you are, so
I'm a little worried, but at least I can trust you in a fight."
60,Ciel,"I feel the same way. Your rationality aside,
you have good instincts."
70,Ciel,"Leave it to me. Whatever it takes,
I'll restore... Shiki to normal."
80,Arcueid,Huh? Did she just say ""my""?
90,Miyako,"Excuse me! Hello, does a bad cat live here?"
100,Neco_Arc,"Huh? Is my pizza here already? I was only just ordering,
that's way too fast."
110,Neco_Arc,"Oh, wait, I know! It's because of that ""dirt cheap super
fiberoptic"" thing I had installed yesterday."
120,Neco_Arc,"It transcends time with tachyons or something like that.
Maybe it's just a step away from future crime prevention?"
130,Neco_Arc,"So that'll be one pizza with double sardines, and as always
I'll pay you after I get rich, so..."
140,Neco_Arc,"Ack, we're under attack!
Where are those mercenaries I hired?!"
150,Ciel,You mean the guards you had on the door?
160,Ciel,"We just explained that you couldn't pay them,
and they all went home."
170,Neco_Arc,Ded Moroz! Mikhail the Engine! Nooo!
180,Neco_Arc,"Hmm. I see, so it's safe to assume...?"
190,Miyako,"That's right, you bad cat! Give me back my brother!
And turn him back to normal!"
200,Miyako,"You're the one who split him, so you know how! Do it and
I'll let you off with just 100 one-inch punches!"
210,Neco_Arc,"Hey, now! That seems a bit excessive!"
220,Neco_Arc,"Imagine the upheaval a hundred one-inch punches
would bring to the world of martial arts!"
230,Neco_Arc,"What does that even mean?! Looks like fighting is the only
way to communicate with you!"
240,Neco_Arc,"Come on, then, kung fu girl! You're my biggest rival,
and my favorite heroine!"
250,Neco_Arc,"My powers get a 30% boost here
in Great Cat's Village!"
260,Neco_Arc,"This is the final match! I'll teach you the true meaning
of a bad ending!"
