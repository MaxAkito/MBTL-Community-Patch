10,Ciel,"Okay, so this crystal statue
just suddenly appeared on my table..."
20,Ciel,"It doesn't seem to be an attack...
My room isn't disturbed, and also..."
30,Ciel,"It's far too well-made!
It looks like a best boyfriend prize!"
40,Ciel,"Is it a present from Shiki,
to encourage me on my routine patrols?"
50,Ciel,"No... Even for that, the dimensions are too perfect."
60,Ciel,"*ahem* This is just a practice exercise, but..."
70,Ciel,"Thank you so much. I love you, my sweet Shiki."
80,C_Shiki,"You don't need practice. I love you too, Ciel."
90,C_Shiki,"Oh, stop. You'll make me blush if you tell me that to
my face. I guess I needed the practice."
100,Ciel, 
110,Ciel,"I-I see how it is. That makes sense.
That cat creature did this, then."
120,Ciel,"I've seen a lot as an Executor, but nothing this strange."
130,Ciel,I'm honestly very confused.
140,C_Shiki,Me too. But I'm glad I can move again.
150,C_Shiki,"You'll handle this rationally, without panicking.
That's reassuring, even when I'm like this."
160,Ciel,"Well, I certainly can't let you down
when you trust me so well."
170,Ciel,"By the way, why were you split into 17ths?"
180,C_Shiki,"Uh... Well, is that important?"
190,Ciel,"Yes, it's very important. My gut says it's the key
to the whole thing."
200,C_Shiki,"W-Well, it's a mystery, isn't it?
You know how cats are."
210,Ciel,"But WHY, though?"
220,C_Shiki,"Sorry, I'll try to explain."
230,C_Shiki,"Instead of me being split into 17 pieces, according to the
cat it's more like I've been split into different dimensions."
240,C_Shiki,"I become your boyfriend in one world, but in another
I end up with someone else, she said."
250,C_Shiki,"There were 17 possibilities that way,
so I was split into each one of those..."
260,C_Shiki,"I know it sounds absolutely insane,
but does it make sense?"
270,Ciel,...
280,C_Shiki,"(Amazing, she actually gets it!)"
290,Ciel,"So... the Shiki that showed up in my home
is the one that ends up with me..."
300,Ciel,"And the other Shikis are the ones that end up with
those people. So..."
310,Ciel,"When I collect all 17 statues and restore you to normal,
that would make you..."
320,C_Shiki,"This all happened because of my flaws,
so I appreciate you being so nice about it."
330,C_Shiki,"But, never mind about that.
I was split up, but I didn't get divided."
340,C_Shiki,"All of the copies of me are equal, so the me that's here
with you won't go away, Ciel."
350,C_Shiki,"All of them are still ""Shiki Tohno"". When I'm restored
to normal, I'll be a combination of all those Shikis."
360,C_Shiki,Although...
370,C_Shiki,I don't think I'd mind if I was the main one.
380,C_Shiki,"If I'm the core when you restore me, you should get the
""Ciel route"" version of Shiki Tohno."
390,C_Shiki,"I'd like that. How about you, Ciel? Does the idea of dating
me in the future turn you off?"
400,Ciel,"N-Not in the least! If that's what you want,
let's do it!"
410,Ciel,"(B-But should I give in to my own wants like that?
 I should put others before my own happiness, shouldn't I...?)"
420,C_Shiki,"Then it's decided. I feel motivated now, too."
430,C_Shiki,"Naturally, I want to do what I can
to impress my crush."
440,Ciel,...
450,Ciel,"*ahem* So, let's get back on topic.
(Just breathe... Deep breaths...)"
460,Ciel,"You don't seem to be in any danger,
but we still want to resolve this quickly."
470,Ciel,"First, the other crystal shards... Oh, that sounds bad.
Let's call them Shiki statues."
480,Ciel,"We'll gather the other Shiki statues,
capture the cat, and restore you."
490,Ciel,"And I'll make you the core when I do.
You...really don't mind that idea?"
500,C_Shiki,"Of course not. But you know one or two people are bound
to interfere when it comes to anything related to me."
510,C_Shiki,"I can handle myself. I have a punchable face, anyway."
520,Ciel,"Okay then. With that set, I'll make sure I'm ready
for anything too."
530,Ciel,"I'll head out to the city right away. You're in danger
at that size, so you stay here, and..."
540,Ciel,"What? There's no need for that.
Excuse me."
550,C_Shiki,"Wh-Whoa! Hey, Ciel?!"
560,Ciel,"You're pocket-sized, Shiki.
I can carry you around safely."
570,C_Shiki,...!
580,Ciel,"Don't struggle so much...
Don't worry, I'll be gentle with you!"
590,Ciel,"Okay, all settled? Now, just be patient for a bit."
600,Ciel,"(Now, all else aside, this is an emergency. This is about
 building a bond with my future lover...)"
610,Ciel,"(There's another Shiki in the alley.
 And then...)"
620,Ciel,"By the way, about that field. I really hope it's not some
simple student-teacher ending."
630,Ciel,"We're all obsessed with our biggest foes when we're young.
And so, we need to thoroughly crush all other possibilities."
640,Powered_Ciel,Amazing. I can't believe there wasn't one here.
650,Powered_Ciel,"That means the last must be... Oh, right.
Of course. I should have known, really."
660,Powered_Ciel,"I have something to do, so let's get this over with.
I'm taking all the Shikis that are here."
670,Powered_Ciel,"I have to ask, do you intend to fight me?"
680,Powered_Ciel,"He's right there, watching, this time.
I have no kindness to spare."
690,Miyako,"O-Of course! I don't really get it, but that would
make you feel better, right, Mother?"
700,Powered_Ciel,"You don't feel betrayed? You don't see me
as the villain here?"
710,Miyako,"Because I know you're doing it for Shiki!
So we're even, and we're the same!"
720,Miyako,"And, it seems like we have one more really
tough enemy left..."
730,Miyako,So I can entrust Shiki to you if I lose to them!
740,Powered_Ciel,...
750,Powered_Ciel,"Very well. Do you have the courage
to decide our destiny in this?"
760,Powered_Ciel,"As your elder, I have to test your limits!"
