10,Akiha,Alright. Are you two ready?
20,Hisui,"Yes. Mistress Miyako and the rest have left,
and no one else is on the property."
30,Kohaku,"Mistress Akiha, you are more devoted to Shiki than anyone,
and you handed over the statue."
40,Kohaku,"Once Ciel and Arcueid hear about it, they will surely
withdraw from searching the manor as well."
50,Kohaku,"Is there any clearer way to signal your innocence?
I have to admit you've outdone yourself, Mistress Akiha."
60,Akiha,"It's nothing so special, Kohaku."
70,Akiha,"I simply determined on the spot that holding onto
the statue would not go well for me."
80,Akiha,"We had four statues here from the start.
All I did was take that into account."
90,Hisui,"You stashed the fourth statue in the study vault
early this morning, right?"
100,Kohaku,"Yes, you took them from the servants without asking! *sob*
It is, of course, your prerogative to do so, but still...!"
110,Akiha,Quiet. My prudence has brought us victory.
120,Akiha,"With Ciel and Arcueid involved, I'm certain my brother
will be restored from his 17 parts."
130,Akiha,"However, surely there is no reason they require
every part, right? They might not."
140,Akiha,"How much damage could be caused by missing 1/17 part?
He was always a bit of an odd boy anyway."
150,Hisui,Mistress Akiha...your reasoning is very...unique...
160,Kohaku,"(Shh, Hisui, pay attention to how she's acting!
 We have to stop her before she goes too far!)"
170,Kohaku,"(Mistress Akiha is the one who will end up in trouble
 no matter how things turn out!)"
180,Hisui,...
190,Akiha,"*ahem* According to Miyako, if we kiss them,
the statues turn human again."
200,Akiha,"Well, then. There is no choice. This is my responsibility."
210,Akiha,"Now... Wake up, dear brother. My brother,
and no one else's."
220,Akiha,I did it...! He's really back!
230,Akiha,"Shiki, you were a statue for so long.
Was it rough? How are you feeling?"
240,H_Shiki_Kakusi,"Whoa, Akiha?!"
250,Akiha,Wha?!
260,H_Shiki_Kakusi,Uh... Huh?
270,H_Shiki_Kakusi,"I see, so the cat hit me with a weird beam...
and that did this to me. Hahaha, what a mess."
280,Akiha,"You're acting kind of odd.
Why did you say ""whoa""?"
290,H_Shiki_Kakusi,"Oh, because you're so big.
That all, really."
300,Akiha,"Well...from your perspective,
I suppose everything is big."
310,Akiha,"Really, though, you're just small.
You're like a little bird, Shiki."
320,Hisui,"She's right. You're vulnerable at that size, Master Shiki.
So..."
330,Hisui,"You're in such danger, I'm very worried.
Please be careful."
340,H_Shiki_Kakusi,"It feels more real when even Hisui says it...
How small am I, then?"
350,Kohaku,"Allow me... Please, don't move..."
360,Kohaku,"My, my... you're like a sitting duck... no, more like
a sparrow...or a hummingbird?"
370,H_Shiki_Kakusi,"Um, Kohaku? Your fingers are a little..."
380,Kohaku,Oh dear. My apologies!Åô
390,Kohaku,"You appear to be about 10 cm tall. An adorable size,
perfect for decorating a shelf somewhere\sf000"
400,H_Shiki_Kakusi,"Whoa, so when I was split into 17, that means..."
410,H_Shiki_Kakusi,"My head hurts. That cat... I would have preferred
one of your usual pranks, Kohaku."
420,Kohaku,Really? Would you forgive me if I had done this?
430,H_Shiki_Kakusi,"Well...mostly. I'd still scold you though.
You and Hisui are special."
440,Hisui,...
450,Kohaku,...
460,Akiha,"(Something seems off...
 But, at least I still have him here.)"
470,Akiha,"(If this goes well, he'll stay in the manor forever,
 with me...)"
480,Akiha,"Heh. I've won. Hisui, Kohaku, a toast!"
490,Akiha,"This is the day of my ascent... We shall call it
The Little Sister Perfect Completion ending!"
500,Miyako,"But, I thought there weren't supposed to be any more
statues on the estate?!"
510,Ciel,"Akiha, Hisui, and Kohaku all
gave us theirs, right?"
520,Ciel,"And no one else lives there, right?
So there should only have been three Shiki statues."
530,Ciel,"It's only natural you'd think that.
But this is MB!"
540,Neco_Arc,"(Hehehe, she's going meta without realizing it...
 I'm steadily transforming Ciel, meow!)"
550,C_Shiki,"I see... the way things are categorized,
there should still be one left. Definitely."
560,Shiki,Huh? Do you know something?
570,C_Shiki,"Why don't we try going back, just to see?
The specifics are too horrible to get into."
580,Shiki,Why is that?
590,C_Shiki,"Because however gentle the person carrying me is,
she can also be terrifying."
600,Ciel,I'm glad we understand each other.
610,Ciel,"Shiki, you know me so well it's a sin,
but there's still no stopping me."
620,Neco_Arc,"Stop with the heartwarming blast furnace of a conversation.
We're almost to the Tohno manor!"
630,Neco_Arc,"The alarm will go off as soon as we enter!
I've done this a lot, so I'm an expert!"
640,Neco_Arc,"We'll have three minutes to get our work done!
After that our safety isn't guaranteed!"
650,Miyako,"You're being weirdly helpful, bad cat!
You'd better not be plotting something!"
660,Neco_Arc,"Cats have a sense of responsibility too, kung fu girl.
Splitting glasses boy up was my mistake."
670,Neco_Arc,"I'll admit that I went too far, even for me.
So I'm turning him back."
680,Neco_Arc,"If defeating just one of him is my life's work, having a lot
of him around if overwhelming, know what I mean?"
690,Neco_Arc,"And besides... I just love stories where you're left
wondering which heroine gets a happy ending."
700,Neco_Arc,"I don't think this is what people mean when they talk
about needing a one romantic interest per main character."
710,Neco_Arc,"You don't get multiple destinies that way,
I guess."
720,Neco_Arc,"I think it's because people dream of finding their
one-and-only."
730,Neco_Arc,"Even if it's not exactly the future that you envisioned,
right?"
740,Miyako,(That's true... You can't undo the past...)
750,Ciel,"Miyako, Shiki! We're now entering the manor!
Prioritize the hunt for the statue!"
760,Akiha,"Honestly, we have to deal not just with visitors at this
hour, but illegal intruders as well?"
770,Akiha,"Do the Arimas not learn manners growing up?
You could easily be mistaken for a burglar...!"
780,Akiha,"Or perhaps it's not a mistake, and you're breaking in.
You've come to steal something precious from me!"
790,Miyako,"Akiha! And Shiki! You have a restored Shiki, too?!"
800,Miyako,Sister was right! You were hiding him! That's cheating!
810,Akiha,Don't act like he's your brother! He's my actual brother!
820,Akiha,"I may have forgiven your childish infatuation
before and let you go..."
830,Akiha,"But now you better watch your mouth,
or be punished for your insolence!"
840,Akiha,"And you do seem to be in need of strict discipline.
As does that fool guiding you from your shoulder."
850,Shiki,"She's being very condescending. Is that girl
really Akiha?"
860,Shiki,"She's so beautiful and cold...
Is she a lookalike?"
870,Akiha,"I can hear you, Shiki. You'd better watch your
tongue, too."
880,Akiha,"Once I've taught Miyako her lesson,
you'll be next."
890,Akiha,"To think you'd make so many rude comments after seven
years apart... No, I won't stand for it!"
900,Akiha,"And so... Yes, I will be thorough and merciless."
910,Akiha,"I will reinforce your discipline,
like this Shiki right here."
920,H_Shiki_Kakusi,I'm so tired.
930,Ciel,"He's so subservient, he must be terribly abused!
What did you do to him, Akiha?!"
940,Akiha,"What? We simply spent four uninterrupted hours
going over his problematic past behavior."
950,Akiha,"And that was simply a light review. We will go through
a more detailed review soon. That was nothing at all."
960,C_Shiki,A four-hour scolding from Akiha?!
970,Ciel,"Just look how much that's affected our Shiki just hearing
about it! Are you trying to ruin him?!"
980,H_Shiki_Kakusi,"She's terribly strict! Save me, Ciel! I'll die at this rate!"
990,Akiha,Shiki? Haven't you been fully reformed yet?
1000,H_Shiki_Kakusi,"See?! Help, save me! Her lessons are going to kill me!
She's a Spartan!"
1010,Shiki,"Is this...something he brought on himself?
He's me, but I don't know..."
1020,Shiki,"For a pretty girl like her to go that far, anyone would
assume he was the problem..."
1030,C_Shiki,"I agree. I think he's a me from a route
where I'm not a great person."
1040,C_Shiki,"Let's go, Ciel. We can leave him here."
1050,C_Shiki,"When I get returned to a single Shiki Tohno, I don't think
I want him to be a part of me."
1060,H_Shiki_Kakusi,"How dare you! Seriously?!
How are you the same person as me?!"
1070,H_Shiki_Kakusi,"You know the situation if you're me!
We're on a straight path to the bad ending!"
1080,Miyako,"The Shikis are fighting...
What should we do, Sister?"
1090,Ciel,"Hahaha... They're all parts of Shiki,
so we can't ignore any of them..."
1100,Ciel,"Oh. Wait, actually... A straight path to
the bad ending?"
1110,Ciel,Excuse me. I have a question for that Shiki.
1120,Ciel,"Could it be that you're not the Shiki that appeared
near Akiha?"
1130,Akiha,"Of course not. I handed that one over to Miyako.
All else aside, I want him back to normal."
1140,Akiha,"This little Shiki was the fourth statue at the manor...
I released him. Is that an issue?"
1150,Ciel,"Oh... I see. You were being smart,
and wanted the best one overall."
1160,Ciel,"But if you had given Miyako that statue,
it wouldn't have gone this way."
1170,Akiha,What are you trying to say?
1180,Ciel,"You could have built a trusting relationship
instead of locking him in a birdcage."
1190,Ciel,"But it can't be helped, I suppose.
That Shiki has problems...or doesn't."
1200,Ciel,"It's natural for him not to favor you, Akiha.
Specifically because..."
1210,Ciel,"He isn't the destined lover for you,
or Hisui, or Kohaku."
1220,Ciel,"He's the Shiki Tohno that could love Hisui & Kohaku.
He's not your Shiki, Akiha."
1230,Akiha,What...?
1240,Miyako,What...?
1250,Neco_Arc,No way.
1260,Akiha,"Wh-What does that mean, Shiki?!
Is that plausible?!"
1270,H_Shiki,Well... I wonder?
1280,Akiha,"I'm the one asking you! That's why you said
""whoa"" before, isn't it?!"
1290,Miyako,Well...
1300,Miyako,"Anyway, that Shiki isn't Akiha's Shiki, right?"
1310,Miyako,"So you can give him to me, right?
Then we can make him back to normal."
1320,Akiha,No.
1330,Akiha,"I will not surrender him. Even with all these problems,
he's still the heir to the Tohno estate..."
1340,Akiha,"My brother, and mine alone. Even if his heart strays."
1350,Ciel,Akiha...
1360,Akiha,"To begin with, Hisui and Kohaku belong to the family.
Their lovers are also my property."
1370,Akiha,"I see no reason to give you what's mine. This Shiki will
spend his life in a birdcage, thinking about what he's done."
1380,H_Shiki,"Oh no! She's back for real! It's a revival of the
""mean lady"" version in our era!"
1390,H_Shiki,Nooooo!
1400,Akiha,"If you still want to take him by force, feel free to try it.
But I won't back down."
1410,Akiha,"I get your two as well, if I win.
Is that acceptable?"
1420,Miyako,"Oh, wow... She's so different from earlier!
Akiha is ready to really fight!"
1430,Ciel,"It seems so. She's too much for you, Miyako.
I'll..."
1440,Miyako,"No, I'll be fine!"
1450,Miyako,"If she's really serious, I can get serious, too!"
1460,Miyako,"I'm the better little sister! I'll give it my all,
even if I can't win!"
