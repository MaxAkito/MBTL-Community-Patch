10,Akiha,"I felt guilty, deep down somewhere...
That determined the outcome of the fight."
20,Akiha,"I don't mind continuing, but...
Ciel wouldn't stand for that, I imagine."
30,Akiha,"Very well. It seems I fell quite a distance,
this time, in a manner of speaking."
40,Akiha,"I will give you my dissolute brother. Here, please return
him to his usual uprooted self."
50,Akiha,"In the meantime, I'll see myself out.
I have no desire to see any ridiculous cat rituals."
60,Akiha,"I will be in the study, working. Please let me know
the outcome once you finish."
70,Ciel,"Let's all follow her example.
Come on, Shiki."
80,Ciel,"Good work on our adventure together.
It was too short, but you helped out a lot."
90,C_Shiki,"Come on, you were the one who helped me."
100,C_Shiki,"Thank you, Ciel. And I'm sorry for all the times
I said too much."
110,Ciel,Cheer up! I enjoyed it a lot.
120,Miyako,"(Oh, that's right... It's time to say goodbye
 to this Shiki...)"
130,Miyako,"(The Shiki before he left for the Tohno manor...
 The Shiki who would've lived with the Arimas forever...)"
140,Shiki,...
150,Miyako,"(But that's not true. I was the one who couldn't
 stop him that day. No one else is to blame.)"
160,Miyako,"(So... this isn't restoring or taking back
 my very own Shiki!)"
170,Miyako,"(It's up to me to take his hand, and to hug him with
 a smile meant from the bottom of my heart!)"
180,Shiki,...
190,Miyako,"Okay. Sorry to keep you waiting, Shiki."
200,Miyako,"I got lost in my head for a second, but I'm fine now.
Thank you for watching out for me."
210,Shiki,"You're welcome. I had a great time adventuring
with you, too."
220,Neco_Arc_Hatena,"Is that really enough for you, meow?
Don't you want more than a good girl gets?"
230,Neco_Arc,"Grr... time out! All of time itself needs to take
a cat nap right now!"
240,Miyako,"Huh? What are you doing, you bad cat?
Are you betraying us at the very end?!"
250,Miyako,"Actually, never mind! Give me anything you got!
I'm ready for any kitty tricks you have up your sleeve!"
260,Neco_Arc,"Now now, hold on. I think you want to hear
what I have to say."
270,Neco_Arc,"You've finally found all 17 glasses kids.
I just have to prism him again and he's fixed."
280,Neco_Arc,"But there are ways to cheat a bit, when I do that."
290,Neco_Arc,"If we bring him back with the gentleman version of the
glasses kid that you've been working with as the core..."
300,Neco_Arc,"Then you're guaranteed to get the Shiki Tohno
who chooses the Miyako route in this world."
310,Neco_Arc,"That's what Ciel was also ""just thinking"" about. She
just resisted the temptation before going through with it."
320,Neco_Arc,So...what do you say?
330,Neco_Arc,"We can go for that, if it's what you want."
340,Neco_Arc,"All else aside, it would be a shame to overwrite
this glasses kid. He's been a pretty good guardian for you."
350,Neco_Arc,"The Cat Council has also concluded that this one
isn't a threat to us."
360,Miyako,Hyah!
370,Miyako,"Whoa, that was close! Sorry, Shiki!"
380,Neco_Arc,"Did negotiations break down? Fine, then.
Want to see my trump card?"
390,Neco_Arc,"You all let your guards down, assuming I was just a cat!
As if! Not even if I died in the multiverse a million times!"
400,Neco_Arc,"I'm going to summon heroes from another world, right now!
Come forth, Miyako Arima's ultimate foe!"
410,Neco_Arc,Yes! I'm calling in an evil Miyako Arima!
420,Negative_Miyako,...
430,Miyako,No way! The cat summoned me?!
440,Negative_Miyako,"I get it. It's so boring having a cat summon you.
I won't be able to eat breakfast for three days after this."
450,Negative_Miyako,But I have to get involved. This concerns me.
460,Negative_Miyako,"""I have to eliminate my weakness before I act,"" huh?"
470,Negative_Miyako,"What a waste. That kind of naive thinking makes me
want to show you real trouble."
480,Miyako,"Eep! She's so haughty, but she's me!
Fine, I'll fight you!"
490,Miyako,"An evil me can't beat the version of me
that's had her eyes opened fighting Akiha!"
500,Negative_Miyako,"Are you sure about that?
We'll find out soon enough."
510,Negative_Miyako,"Can the Souya Miyako beat the Misaki Miyako?
The cat thinks this is a battle between old and new."
520,Negative_Miyako,Let's see if you can measure up to what I've achieved!
