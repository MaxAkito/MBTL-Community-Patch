190,Neco_Arc,"But you're alone now! Your habit of heading out to see what's
happening on your own has come back to bite you in the butt!"
200,Neco_Arc,This glasses kid is way too tough!
210,Neco_Arc,"Ah, but if I capture the protagonist it's the same as winning,
those brutal heroines will have to obey me..."
220,Neco_Arc,"To think that my perfect plan could fail
at the very last moment..."
230,Shiki,"It was doomed from the start, not the last moment.
Seriously, why does this stuff always happen to me?"
240,Shiki,"It's fine, go home. I won't stop you.
You didn't even want to kill me this time."
250,Shiki,"Learn your lesson and don't come back. Try to find
a way to live peacefully in your whatever-village."
260,Neco_Arc,"Glasses kid... How are you so...
How..."
270,Neco_Arc,You're such a main character through and through! How?!
290,Shiki,"Yeah, yeah. Your usual beam, right?
Shield."
300,Shiki,"Ahh, it's so bright?!
Is this another weird new technique?!"
310,Neco_Arc,"Nyahaha! Goodbye, good boy!
This isn't a standard visible light laser!"
320,Neco_Arc,"It's forbidden cat magic a mysterious stranger
from another world taught me! ÅhPrism Split BeamÅh!"
330,Shiki,"Prism... what?
Agh, arghhhh?!"
340,Neco_Arc,Allow me to explain.
350,Neco_Arc,"The Prism Split Beam. It posits that the main character
ends up with each heroine in a different timeline,"
360,Neco_Arc,"and uses forbidden magic to focus that onto
the ""Shiki Tohno"" in this timeline."
370,Neco_Arc,"Even if you're only kind of the main character, you should
have three or four, or even five or six endings."
380,Neco_Arc,This beam splits your strength by that number of endings!
390,Neco_Arc,"You're not so tough at one-sixth strength!
I'll take you down one-by-one!"
400,Neco_Arc,"Huh?! Why didn't you split into six glasses-cats, and why did
you turn into 3D crystal statues (which are hard to come by)?"
410,Neco_Arc,"Not to mention... one... two... five... ten... 17? You split
into 17? Are you a multi-ending master or something?"
420,Neco_Arc,"Does that mean you end up with 17 different heroines?
What is wrong with you?!"
430,Neco_Arc,Mya?! H-Hey...!
440,Neco_Arc,Uh-oh...
