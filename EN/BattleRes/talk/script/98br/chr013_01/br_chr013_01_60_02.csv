290,Neco_Arc,"Arghhh! I can't believe I took damage and need to retreat
before getting back the very first one!"
300,Miyako,"Got 'er... Might have gone a bit overboard...
Goodbye, bad cat. Enjoy your time in space!"
310,Miyako,"Anyway, not sure what that was all about,
but the sudden evil is vanquished."
320,Miyako,"So I'll just compose myself...
and take my reward!"
330,Miyako,"Heheheh. I'm blushing!
I'm so glad to have you here, Shiki!"
340,Miyako,Huh?
350,Miyako,"No way...
Shiki just turned into Shiki!"
360,Shiki,"Phew, thought I'd be stuck like that forever."
370,Shiki,"Thanks, Miyako. You saved me.
It seems like you restored me to normal."
380,Miyako,"Oh, you're welcome, but..."
390,Miyako,"Um. You're... really little, aren't you?"
400,Shiki,Oh yeah. I guess I am...
