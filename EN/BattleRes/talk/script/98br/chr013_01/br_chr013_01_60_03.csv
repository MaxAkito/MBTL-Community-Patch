520,Shiki,"I take it back! Stop, Miyako!
It's too dangerous to keep this up."
530,Shiki,"I think she's holding back, so let's try talking!"
540,Ciel,(I knew it! I wasn't just seeing things!)
550,Ciel,"I'm sorry. Your name is Miyako, is it?"
560,Ciel,"Oh, might you be the eldest daughter of the Arima family?
Shiki's younger sister, right?"
570,Ciel,"That would make us allies. Nice to meet you, young lady.
I'm Ciel. I know Shiki from school."
580,Ciel,"It appears we have the same goal, but
could you tell me what's going on?"
590,Miyako,"O-Oh, I see. If you're in school with him,
that means you're a lot older than me!"
600,Miyako,"And you're tough and pretty, and you seem nice.
Can I call you Ma-- er, I mean, can I call you Sister?"
610,Ciel,"Yes. You're so polite.
And your smile is nice. I'm jealous, Shiki."
620,Miyako,"Tehehe. She thinks I'm a good little sister, Shiki!
Shiki...?"
630,Shiki,"Yeah. I agree Miyako's a good girl,
but I'm not so sure about the rest."
640,Shiki,"You said your name is Ciel? I've never seen you before.
Do you really go to my school?"
650,Miyako, 
660,Ciel,Oh... I see. So that's what happened.
670,Miyako, 
680,Ciel,"I understand the situation better now, but it's more
depressing."
690,Ciel,This is Shiki from before he met me.
700,Ciel,"This is part of what they call a multiverse...
That cat really made a mess of things this time."
710,Shiki, ???
720,Miyako, ???
730,Ciel,"This means I'm not your upperclassman yet,
I think. I guess that's it."
740,Ciel,"You have memories of her, don't you?
Akiha Tohno, your younger sister."
750,Miyako,...
760,Shiki,"Of course. She's my little sister by blood.
I haven't seen her in seven years, though."
770,Miyako,"Huh? Shiki, that's..."
780,Ciel,"It's wrong, but it makes sense, Miyako.
As the more mature person here, allow me to explain."
790,Ciel,"Basically, the Shiki you see there is from before
he went to live with the Tohno family."
800,Ciel,"So he doesn't know me yet.
(And naturally, he also doesn't know Arcueid.)"
810,Shiki,"Oh, I get it. So each split version of me is different
in some way."
820,Ciel,Hehe. I'm glad you catch on as quickly as ever.
830,Ciel,"This Shiki is the one that thinks of you foremost. Basically,
he's the Shiki who is 'Miyako Arima's big brother'."
840,Ciel,"I'd guess that all of the different Shiki's ended up
near his 'destined love' for that part."
850,Ciel,"One body for each destiny.
It's all very heartwarming."
860,Ciel,"Well, some people might say 'that's too much love'
under the circumstances. And that's just their opinion."
870,Shiki,"Th-They wouldn't say that, surely. It's not like you can play
all the routes simultaneously."
880,Ciel,"Hehehe. We'll talk more over that in more
depth later."
890,Ciel,"Could you tell me about what's happened to you?
To be honest, I'm not quite sure I get it yet."
900,Miyako,"...so that's about it.
He was there when I woke up."
910,Miyako,"And then the bad cat came, and we have to collect
the other crystal statues."
920,Ciel,I see... So you ran into the cat before I did.
930,Ciel,"In any case, we share the same goal.
I'm on team 'return Shiki to normal' too."
940,Ciel,"I'll leave the one that landed in this field to you,
Miyako."
950,Ciel,"And this one, too. I found it."
960,Miyako,"Oh... Are you sure? This Shiki is your Shiki,
Sister..."
970,Ciel,"It's not healthy for him to be like this.
Leaving him with you seems safest."
980,Miyako,"Th-Thank you so much! This plus the other two makes
it my third Shiki!"
990,Ciel,I don't know how I feel about that phrasing...
1000,Ciel,"Here's the problem, though.
I have an idea about at least two more."
1010,Ciel,"Let's head back to Souya,
so I can contact them."
1020,Ciel,"It will probably lead to a fight, so be ready.
They're not the types to listen to reason."
1030,Shiki, ???
1040,Miyako, ???
