380,Arcueid,"I'm sorry, I got carried away...
So you're Shiki from before we met..."
390,Miyako,"Not at all, I learned a lot, too!
You really hit hard, Arcueid!"
400,Ciel,"With that out of the way, shall we move along?
The situation is as I explained."
410,Ciel,"The mysterious creature split Tohno into 17 copies,
and the copies went to people who know him."
420,Ciel,One to Miyako. One to me. And so...
430,Arcueid,"I have it here. The crystal Shikis, right?
So that's what this was all about."
440,Arcueid,"I thought it was a present from Shiki,
but it's not really something he'd get me."
450,Arcueid,"Fine. I'll help you get him back to normal.
I don't like Ciel being in charge, though."
460,Shiki,Thank you. You're just as nice as you look.
470,Arcueid,...
480,Akiha,"*ahem* I understand. I don't fully comprehend it,
but I'll help, too."
490,Akiha,"But first, I have a question."
500,Akiha,"My brother... the eldest of the family over there.
Why... Why is he... in that form?"
510,Akiha,"The Shiki I have is still crystal.
Arcueid's is, too."
520,Akiha,"I don't see how Miyako alone
is just that special."
530,Ciel,"Good question. Why is he like that,
Miyako?"
540,Miyako,"W-Well... Um! Th-There's... a secret trick,
I think!"
550,Akiha,"Could you tell us more about it in detail, please?"
560,Shiki,"I want to know, too. The other statues might
turn back into me, too."
570,Miyako,"I-It's a secret! You can't hear about it!
Wait here!"
580,Miyako,"So... keep this secret, okay?"
590,Miyako,"Um... I k-kissed mine, then it glowed, and there was light,
and he went back to normal."
600,Arcueid,"Oh, I get it. I kind of wanted to do that
with mine, too!"
610,Akiha,"S-So you kissed it?!
That exquisite copy of my brother?!"
620,Ciel,"Is that so shocking? It's obvious if you think of the story
of the Frog Prince."
630,Miyako,I just didn't know it was real at the time!
640,Miyako,"Please, please, please keep it a secret!
I don't want him to hate me if he finds out!"
650,Shiki,Hey! Are you all done talking?
660,Miyako,W-We're done! We don't know what brought you back!
670,Shiki,Oh. That's too bad...
680,Ciel,"So, now we need to collect the split Shikis
as quickly as possible, but... Akiha?"
690,Akiha,...
700,Akiha,"(If I kiss him, the Shiki that I received
 will also transform like that...)"
710,Ciel,Akiha? Is something on your mind?
720,Akiha,"No... It's nothing. I'm just thinking things out as head
of the Tohno household."
730,Akiha,"We must collect all the copies of my brother as quickly
as possible. We should split up, and... Arcueid?"
740,Arcueid,Hmmm... Mmm...
750,Arcueid,Aaaaagh! I hate it but fine!
760,Arcueid,"Okay, here you go, little-little sister!
This is the fourth Shiki!"
770,Ciel,"Arcueid, were you carrying yours around, too?!"
780,Arcueid,"What's wrong with that? Even if he's just a statue,
I always want Shiki with me."
790,Arcueid,"But it worked out. I saved us the time of going
back home to get him!"
800,Arcueid,"How about you, Akiha? You're so polite,
usually, but not now."
810,Akiha,"Of course. I didn't know where it was from,
or what it was, but..."
820,Akiha,"It looked exactly like him.
Naturally, I couldn't let go of him. But..."
830,Akiha,"(With these two being so mature,
 I can't back down!)"
840,Akiha,"Here you are. He's a problematic person, but I
don't want to cause even more trouble for the Tohno heir."
850,Arcueid,"Okay, let's hurry and find the others!
I'll go do a quick check of the south side of town!"
860,Arcueid,"How about you, Ciel?
Want to compete to see who finds the most?"
870,Ciel,"Of course. I always love to beat you.
I'll take the north side."
880,Akiha,"I'll head back to the manor.
Miyako, Shiki, you should come, too."
890,Akiha,"At the manor... Well, there are two more of
those statues."
900,Akiha,"You may have to feud with their owners a bit,
but I think if you speak with them directly..."
910,Akiha,"You might find some sort of solution
that satisfies everyone."
920,Miyako,"Um, so..."
930,Akiha,"However it came to pass,
you're looking out for my brother, right?"
940,Akiha,"In that case, I can't just cast you aside.
Plus you've brought me wonderful news..."
950,Akiha,"In light of the person riding on your shoulder,
I am pleased to welcome you, the heiress of the Arima family."
