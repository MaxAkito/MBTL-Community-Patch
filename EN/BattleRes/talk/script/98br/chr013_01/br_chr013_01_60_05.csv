410,Akiha,"She was a strange one,
but I'll admit she was tough."
420,Akiha,"Good work, Miyako. You move well.
I can tell you train often."
430,Miyako,"Th-Thank you so much! It's all thanks to Shiki
for watching over me every day!"
440,Akiha,"Oh, really? Every day? He really loves his little sister,
doesn't he?"
450,Shiki,"Oh, haha. I don't know if it was every single day.
Is she going to kill me when we get home...?"
460,Shiki,"Putting that aside for now, that Sister...
or was she actually a magical girl?"
470,Shiki,"She said the cat is collecting copies of me, too.
We have to hurry so that she doesn't get ahead of us."
510,Akiha,"Arcueid and Ciel can search the town
all day without stopping."
500,Akiha,"Getting the others...
probably won't be a problem."
520,Akiha,"We need to head for the Tohno manor
before the cat can interfere."
530,Ciel,So Sister Noel lost...
540,Ciel,"She was always the biggest troublemaker out of all of us,
so that's no surprise..."
550,C_Shiki_Hatena,...?
560,Ciel,"Yes. This clarified everything. All of the Shikis appear
near those deeply tied to him..."
570,Ciel,"As the cat would put it, those with ""heroine potential""
receive them."
580,Ciel,But that doesn't mean everyone got one.
590,Ciel,"For people out of town now, or one-sided relationships,
or simple acquaintances..."
600,Ciel,"The copies associated with those who can't receive them
end up scattered all over..."
610,Ciel,"They're more-or-less undelivered mail, essentially."
620,C_Shiki_Hatena,...?
630,Ciel,That's a bit harsh. I take that back.
640,Ciel,"Anyway, I have no idea how the cat intends to misuse
the undelivered Shikis."
660,Ciel,"If we get at least 80 percent of the 17 Shikis, that should
be enough to restore him."
670,Ciel,"A part of me does recognize that Sister Noel's
nasty idea would work, but..."
680,Ciel,"Unfortunately, none of them have realized
what is more important."
690,Ciel,"That means I still have a chance.
Let's do our best, Shiki!"
