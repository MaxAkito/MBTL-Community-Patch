150,Miyako,Ungh! Hyaaaa!
160,Miyako,"That's a two-win streak!
Thanks for the matches, maids!"
170,Kohaku,"Not at all. You were quite impressive, too,
Mistress Miyako."
180,Kohaku,"Please, take this."
190,Kohaku,"While it pains me to say it, this is the best approach."
200,Miyako,"Yay!
Got it!"
210,Shiki,"(Not sure how I feel about being treated as an object this
 way, but as her brother I want to praise Miyako's efforts.)"
220,Akiha,"So, are we all done here?
Please handle the rest on your own."
230,Akiha,"With these two helping, you won't need my aid."
240,Akiha,"We'll be leaving you here. Come along, Hisui and Kohaku."
250,Miyako,She actually left. Is this really okay?
260,Shiki,"Yeah, I was sure she'd keep an eye on us until the end,
but instead... She must have something else to do."
270,Miyako,"Yeah, my dad said that the Tohnos
are always busy with something."
280,Miyako,"Okay, let's head back to the park!
Time to meet up with Arcueid and the Sister!"
290,Arcueid,"Sorry to keep you waiting!
Are either of you injured?"
300,Miyako,We're fine! We made it to the manor safely!
310,Shiki,"Either of... oh, you mean me? I appreciate your concern,
even in this situation."
320,Shiki,"Thank you, Arcueid. You really are as nice as you look."
330,Arcueid,...
340,Shiki,Arcueid?
350,Arcueid,"Oh, it's nothing. Just something personal.
Anyway, yeah! We got'em!"
360,Miyako,"That many?! Arcueid, you're amazing!"
370,Arcueid,"Yes, please, tell me more about how amazing I am!"
380,Arcueid,"I couldn't stand leaving Shiki by himself
in any form, so I tried really hard!"
390,Shiki,...
400,Arcueid,"Hmph. So I did good, then?"
410,Shiki,"Oh, um, yeah, sorry. You did. Thank you very much."
420,Shiki,"But, um... (you've been such a good help...)"
430,Shiki,"I'm just sorry I don't recognize you.
I'm sure the other me would put it better."
440,Arcueid," "
450,Arcueid,"Would he? Shiki, you're always so harsh with me."
460,Arcueid,"But I like this version of you, too, little guy.
It's a nice change to have a soft Shiki!"
470,Shiki, 
480,Arcueid,"Anyway, all that aside,
here you go, Miyako."
490,Miyako_and_Shiki,Whoa!
500,Arcueid,"How about it? We have 15 all together.
That's enough to put him back together, right?"
510,Arcueid,"Waiting on Ciel doesn't sit right with me,
so let's get started!"
520,Shiki,Seriously?!
530,Shiki,"No, no way, that's way too reckless!
Two seventeenths would be like him losing an arm!"
540,Arcueid,"Oh, right. Humans don't regenerate lost parts, do they?"
550,Arcueid,"Sorry. So 15 isn't enough. But 16 would be, right?"
560,Shiki,(Okay. I was definitely wrong about that smile earlier.)
570,Shiki,"Let's wait until we get them all. I'd feel much better if you
have all of me before trying anything, princess."
580,Arcueid,"Eep?! Oh, sure, you're right! Lets do that!
You can trust me!"
590,Ciel,"Oh, we're all here now. Unfortunately, I didn't have
any luck... What's this?"
600,Ciel,"Something doesn't feel right.
What happened, Arcueid?"
610,Arcueid,"I'm not telling you. Honestly, Ciel, you really excel
at being nothing but trouble."
620,Ciel,"I can't deny that, but I wouldn't go that far either. I don't
want people thinking trouble is the only thing I'm good at."
630,Shiki,"Oh, really? I think Ms. Arcueid was implying that
you're still good at everything else."
635,Ciel,...
640,Ciel,"A-Anyway, what's the situation now?
How is the Shiki statue hunt going?"
650,Miyako,"...and with that, we have a total of 15!
Just two more crystal statues left!"
660,Arcueid,"But we've hit a wall. I raced all over town, ignoring you,
Ciel, and I didn't find any others."
670,Arcueid,"If they're out there, it seems like someone must have them."
680,Arcueid,"If we don't have any leads, why not raze the city
to the ground?"
690,Miyako,?
700,Shiki,?
710,Ciel,"There's no need for that,
so please keep such ideas to yourself."
720,Ciel,"That cat-like creature probably has the rest.
We can resolve this by capturing and questioning her."
730,Ciel,"Also, while I left the statue hunt to Arcueid,
I did find the enemy's hideout."
740,Ciel,Follow me. It's time to solve the case of the split Shiki!
