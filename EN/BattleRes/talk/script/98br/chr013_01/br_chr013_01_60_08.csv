270,Miyako,Yes! I did it!
280,Shiki,"You're the one who ended up in a bad ending.
I gave you a taste of your own medicine."
290,Neco_Arc,Uh. What the heck is this?
300,Shiki,"You don't know? I'm one of the 17 Shikis you split apart.
I don't know why I'm the only one that can move, though."
310,Shiki,"Anyway, give us the rest of the statues and undo that beam.
I'm getting fed up with all this."
320,Neco_Arc,No can do!Åô
330,Miyako,What?! You bad cat! Explain yourself!
340,Neco_Arc,"Well, think about it. Do you really think a cat can do
something so difficult as putting someone back together?"
350,Shiki,...
360,Neco_Arc,"Oh, hold on, I can. Probably. If I try a Prism Split Beam
with my eyes spinning the opposite way..."
370,Neco_Arc,"But it's dangerous for meow, too! Don't you know I need to
make a Death Saving Throw every time I fire a Prism Beam?!"
380,Shiki,"So it's a life or death attack either way. But it's still
worth a chance to give it a try, right?"
390,Neco_Arc,"Yeah. I'll definitely die if I don't do what you say, huh?"
400,Neco_Arc,"Still, let me just say this! I don't have any statues!"
410,Miyako, 
420,Shiki, 
430,Neco_Arc,"If giving them up would save me
I would have done that already."
440,Neco_Arc,"Everyone, think back."
450,Neco_Arc,"I went to get the first one from Miyako, in her home,
and then what happened?"
460,Neco_Arc,"I got launched into space for a sad life among the stars.
Do you really think I could've searched the city after that?"
470,Neco_Arc,Not a chance!Åô
480,Neco_Arc,"All I did was fight through the pain and talk to some sad,
useless office worker..."
490,Neco_Arc,"Even knowing it wouldn't work, I tried to get her
to collect them. Other than that, I've been here."
500,Neco_Arc,"And Miyako, please don't hit me so hard next time."
510,Miyako,"Y-Yeah, I guess I overdid it,
launching you into space..."
520,Miyako,"But that's not the point!
Where did the rest of Shiki go?!"
530,Neco_Arc,"Probably another potential heroine.
One of them must have them hidden, meow."
540,Neco_Arc,"For example, whoever got started hunting first."
550,Neco_Arc,"Was anyone else hunting for statues
with an early start like you, Miyako?"
560,Miyako,Hmm... Oh!
570,Shiki,No way... Eep!
580,C_Shiki,"Ahh, that didn't go so well.
It's hard to ambush yourself."
590,Miyako,Mother!
600,Ciel,"Please, Miyako, call me Sister.
It's too bad you noticed me."
610,Ciel,"I don't want to be rough with you,
so please, just stay were you are."
620,Ciel,And Shiki? Please don't try to resist.
630,Ciel,"Even though you need to be punished for all these endings,
you don't want to get stepped on at that size, do you?"
