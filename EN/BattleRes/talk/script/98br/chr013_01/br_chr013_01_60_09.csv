770,C_Shiki,"Ahh, that didn't go so well.
It's hard to ambush yourself."
780,Shiki,"Oh, so he's me, too. That messes with things.
He'll be in the way, I bet."
790,Shiki,"If there's another me that can move,
that makes every Shiki equal."
800,Shiki,"Whoever comes out on top makes no difference in who stays.
You can't really compare destinies."
810,Shiki,"I just have to focus on who cares... No.
I have to focus on who I really care about."
820,C_Shiki,"Exactly. I'm glad you're a smart version of me.
And now, I'll get rid of you here."
830,Shiki,"Umm, I'm not sure that's a very good idea.
Look at the two key players."
840,Shiki,"If we kill each other, we just make them sad. If it's about
destiny, shouldn't we stay with them to the end?"
850,C_Shiki,"Argh... going by experience, I can't argue that, can I?
You're right."
860,C_Shiki,"Ahh, if only Ciel were more self-centered,
we could've had a 17-person battle royale."
870,Ciel,"You win. You beat me, Miyako."
880,Ciel,I entrust you with the duty of resolving the situation.
890,Ciel,"Is that alright with you, Shiki? I'm sorry I couldn't
pull it off, even with the age advantage."
900,C_Shiki,"It's fine, really. I know you by now, Ciel."
910,C_Shiki,"Anyway, it was my fault for urging you on.
In the end I just ran you around pointlessly."
920,Ciel,"No, don't say that. My thoughts, even the devious ones,
are all my own."
930,Ciel,"Oh, but don't turn back into a statue now."
940,Ciel,"You led me into my evil deeds,
so you have to stick with me."
950,C_Shiki,"Right. I'd be happy to stick with you,
if that's what you want."
960,Miyako,Ah... Um... What is going on here?!
970,Shiki,"Nothing, just that your Shiki will stay with you
like that for a bit longer."
980,Shiki,"It seems like she knows
where the last statue is."
990,Ciel,"Yes, I'll take us right there.
You're coming too, cat-creature."
1000,Ciel,"The last Shiki statue is in a special place...
It has to be in the Tohno manor."
