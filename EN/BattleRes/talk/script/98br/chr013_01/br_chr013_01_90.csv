530,Negative_Miyako,"Well, that's settled. You're better than I thought,
but you're done now, right?"
540,Miyako,"Urgh! You're me, but you're so tough!
It's not fair!"
550,Negative_Miyako,Of course. I'm you from the future.
560,Negative_Miyako,""I have to eliminate my weakness before I act"" and so on.
570,Negative_Miyako,"If you're going to be so naive, you at least need to be
as tough as me, right?"
580,Miyako,"Huh? So, you're..."
590,Negative_Miyako,"Just kidding! We're from different worlds.
Bye, Souya Miyako!"
600,Negative_Miyako,"Go learn three times, no, ten times as much kung fu!
Then you'll be ready to even think of fighting me!"
610,Miyako,Okay! I can definitely get stronger now!
620,Miyako,"Just watch! I'll have some sushi and do my best,
and then I'll beat you!"
630,Miyako,"Yeah...I'll do that...
My ultimate bajiquan... Zzz..."
640,Neco_Arc,"She beat her own future self!
Is she the heroine at age 12?!"
650,Neco_Arc,"Still...she's just a kid.
She gets tired when it's only 10 at night."
660,Neco_Arc,"Miyako is down, Ciel is underground thanks to
hacker Kohaku..."
670,Neco_Arc,"And the rich girl is hiding in the study in anguish.
So I win this one."
680,Neco_Arc,"Now then, I have all the glasses kids that were split apart!Åô
 I'll just sell the 3D crystals in a bazaar, get rich, and..."
690,Shiki,Hello there. There's no moon out tonight.
700,Neco_Arc,Eeep?! Y-Y-You're back to normal?! How can this be?!
710,Shiki,"Determination. With all the different copies together,
somehow I managed it."
720,Neco_Arc,"Argh, to think you'd have the mental fortitude...! The
protagonist-y potential! This upset in the story means...!"
730,Shiki,"Yeah, and I don't think 17 copies will be enough for you.
108 should just about do it, don't you think?"
740,Neco_Arc,That seems significant.
750,Shiki,"...and that's how it all worked out. I don't remember
anything from when I was split, but..."
760,Shiki,"You helped save me too, right, Arcueid?
Thank you."
770,Arcueid,"Oh? Well, I appreciate the thanks.
I had fun though, so there's really no need."
780,Arcueid,"But isn't Ciel just awful? She abandoned me completely
at the door!"
790,Arcueid,"I was waiting forever! Someone should have called me
for the final fight!"
800,Shiki,"Well, I think she was being considerate...in her own way.
Things could have gotten wild if you were there."
810,Arcueid,"You're taking Ciel's side again?
And just how was she being considerate?"
820,Arcueid,"The world will end before Ciel
does anything considerate towards me."
830,Shiki,"(Well, I think she is a lot of the time...
but I'd better not say that.)"
840,Shiki,"Oh, there's something bugging me, by the way."
850,Shiki,"According to Ciel, you just handed over the statues.
Is that true?"
860,Shiki,"Why did you do that?
Did you just really like Miyako?"
870,Arcueid,Why? Uh... Do I really have to say it?
880,Shiki,"Yes. I want to know. If you won't tell me,
I won't make dinner tonight."
890,Arcueid,"It's true that I wanted you back to normal
as soon as possible, but..."
900,Arcueid,"At the same time, you were so tiny, Shiki..."
910,Arcueid,"I also just didn't want to be a giant monster next to you.
So I held off on kissing you."
920,Shiki,...
930,Arcueid,"I was super, super jealous of your
little sister, but it turned out well!"
940,Arcueid,"We're here together now, thanks to me!
I'm unstoppable now that I've learned patience, right?!"
950,Shiki,"Oh, come on. You've always been unstoppable."
960,Shiki,"You're right, though, about everything. I'll make it up
to you, to apologize for making you wait."
970,Arcueid,What...? Oh.
980,Arcueid,"Okay. I'll accept that.
With gratitude for your hardest worker, right?"
