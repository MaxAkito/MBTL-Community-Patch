10,Arcueid,"Hey, Shiki! I'm coming in!
Thanks for inviting me over today!"
20,Shiki,"Who, me?
I don't remember doing that..."
30,Shiki,"(And calling Arcueid over in the afternoon...
Å@I don't have that much of a death wish...wait, Hisui?)"
40,Hisui,"Lady Arcueid.
I apologize for the trouble in asking you here today."
50,Hisui,"Lady Akiha is occupied with other guests and cannot
join us, and thus I will be acting in her place."
60,Arcueid,"Did my little sister have something for you to do?
Who could be so important as to make me wait?"
70,Hisui,"I am unfortunately unable to answer questions
regarding Lady Akiha's schedule."
80,Hisui,"I have given you a copy of Master Shiki's schedule,
so please follow that for the day."
90,Shiki,"Yeah, that thing I got after breakfast...
It's more of a checklist than a schedule, isn't it?"
100,Hisui,"Aside from reaching the checkpoints and achieving goals
before the end of the day, it has no restrictions."
110,Hisui,"Go for a stroll, have a chat, do battle.
Feel free to have fun however you like!"
120,Arcueid,"Isn't that essentially just a date?
Come on! You could've just said so if that was it!"
130,Arcueid,"Aww, thank you for being considerate!
Neither your sister nor your maid are honest with themselves!"
140,Shiki,"(Walking and chatting would be fine, but doing battle?)"
150,Hisui,"I should have mentioned this earlier,
but please put Master Shiki's safety first."
160,Hisui,"Any roughhousing will disqualify you on the spot,
and you will be ejected from the manor."
170,Hisui,"And, according to my sister,
it would make Lady Akiha cry."
180,Hisui,"As for Master Shiki, please be mindful of your actions,
as he is the Tohno family heir."
190,Hisui,"Now, do take care."
200,Arcueid,Huh? Why would she cry?
210,Shiki,"I don't know. I really don't, Arcueid.
Anyway, let's stick to these plans."
220,Shiki,"She's scary when she's mad.
It would be a big problem for me."
230,Arcueid,Hmm...
240,Shiki,"Still, while it isn't the first time she's used the word
""cry,"" since she came back it seems rather out of character."
250,Shiki,"If Akiha did that now, I would be overcome by
terror of unprecedented depth and intensity."
260,Shiki,That's the feeling I get.
270,Arcueid,"You're like a sommelier for flavors of your sister's wrath...
Fine, since it would cause you problems..."
280,Arcueid,"I'll give it my best for you today!
We're going to have a wonderful time on our date!"
290,Shiki,"No, there's no need to try that hard.
I was saying that we should have a quiet day today."
300,Arcueid,"Don't worry! If your sister gets worked up,
I'll comfort her for you."
310,Arcueid,"Also...that actually sounds like something I'd like to see.
I've always wanted to see her get emotional."
320,Shiki,"You seriously want to provoke her rage, don't you?!"
