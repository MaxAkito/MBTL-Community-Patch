10,Arcueid,...
20,Shiki,"Right, next is the purification of the church.
Purification...of a church?"
30,Shiki,"Something doesn't feel right. It's making my head spin.
The sky looks odd, too... Hey, there's someone there."
40,Arcueid,"Oh dear. There's the problem.
Can I take her out, Shiki?"
50,Shiki,"Don't be an idiot! Who just attacks someone like that?!
Let's at least hear her out!"
60,Arcueid,"Don't call me an idiot!
I even asked if it was okay before killing her!"
70,Shiki,"Anyway, stand down. Stay.
I mean, she's... Urk. My head!"
80,Arcueid,"Shiki, are you alright?
Want me to take her down after all?"
90,Dead_Noel,"As if you could. Shut up and listen,
instead of running off your mouth."
100,Dead_Noel,"I'm not the reason your boyfriend is in pain.
It's almost certainly his own fault, because of how he lives."
110,Dead_Noel,Don't be in such a hurry to pin the blame on me.
120,Arcueid,"But you really do look pretty weak.
Like, I'm pretty sure I could take you easily."
130,Dead_Noel,"What?! I'm not weak, and it would not be easy!
I'm planning to take down your boyfriend!"
140,Arcueid,"Oh, I see."
150,Arcueid,"So, are we good?"
160,Dead_Noel,"Eep!
Are you trying to kill me with the emotional intensity?!"
170,Dead_Noel,"Stop that! Let's talk about this!
Talk! With words!"
180,Dead_Noel,"Did you hear what my prey said when he warned you?
He said to hear me out first. That's smart, right?"
190,Arcueid,"Heehee, right!
Only Shiki calls me an idiot and gets away with it!"
200,Dead_Noel,"Why are you happy about that?!
Anyway! You're not getting past me, no matter what!"
210,Dead_Noel,"Oh, I see. I probably would have run in the past,
but I'm a different person now!"
220,Shiki,"(I was right. She kept quiet because she was watching
Å@to see if we'd run or fight...)"
230,Dead_Noel,If you insist on going ahead...
240,Dead_Noel,"Hm, I know, why don't you try giving an order
to your ""Servant"" or whatever it is?"
250,Dead_Noel,"You mock the Twenty-seven Dead Apostles?
Go on! Do it! Do me next!"
260,Arcueid,"Eh?
Nah, can't be bothered."
270,Dead_Noel,Can't be bothered?!
280,Arcueid,"Well, I don't get anything out of it, do I?
You don't interest me at all."
290,Dead_Noel,"Is that so?
Then I'll just make sure you never forget me, even in death!"
300,Dead_Noel,"You're no True Ancestor princess! I'm the real princess!
I'll defeat you and take the crown for myself!"
310,Arcueid,"Oh, what's this?
You're not bad."
320,Dead_Noel,"Of course!
My power's jumped up twice now with shady injections!"
330,Dead_Noel,"And I'll gain just as much power again with this
'Giant Killing' defeat of the True Ancestor princess!"
340,Dead_Noel,"I can push the multiplier on my Jumping Chance too,
and gain up to ten times as much power."
350,Dead_Noel,"So you want to be some gorilla princess with strength alone?!
I'm the princess of dreams and slumber, on that front!\sf000"
360,Dead_Noel,"I will bring real order to the Dead Apostles... nay! A new
True Ancestor for a new era, everyone's beloved Noel-chan!"
370,Arcueid_and_Shiki,... (*cringe*)
380,Dead_Noel,"Huh?
I expected at least a wail of despair or something."
390,Dead_Noel,"Is my plan so far-sighted and lofty it left you speechless?
Have I already won, on a spiritual level?"
400,Arcueid,"You could say it's too lofty, or even a total fantasy...
And definitely too embarrassing to say if you were
in your right mind..."
410,Shiki,"And two double leaps in power would utterly destroy you.
Are you sure you don't have a death wish?"
420,Dead_Noel,How dare you?!
430,Arcueid,"Anyway, that's not even how True Ancestors are.
I guess I'll have to correct you a bit..."
440,Arcueid,"Besides, you seem like you'll cause trouble
for Shiki and Noel."
450,Arcueid,"You just... look like the heroine of a story,
know what I mean?"
460,Dead_Noel,"I-I do?
Is that how I look?"
470,Arcueid,"Yeah, so I'm going to go all out.
No restraint, no mercy, okay?"
480,Dead_Noel,"(Oh. Oh God.
Å@I'm going to die!)"
