10,Arcueid,"As expected, Mecha-Ciel!
So you got captured and upgraded?"
20,Ciel,"I don't know where you heard that nonsense,
and I hate to disappoint you, but I'm the normal Ciel."
30,Shiki,"Huh? So Akiha and Hisui
didn't send you here?"
40,Ciel,"They didn't.
I also doubt Akiha would ask anything of me."
50,Ciel,"I just launched an attack on you
because you were being so careless and unvigilant."
60,Arcueid,"Hmph. So, what's your move now?
Going to fire off some overpowered beam again,
or an over-the-top satellite laser?"
70,Arcueid,"I don't care either way, but if you use some kind of crazy
weaponry, they're all going to blame you for the damage."
80,Ciel,"Don't worry, I wouldn't do that
against such a dim, witless foe."
90,Arcueid,"'Dim'...? Do you speak modern English?
What does that even mean?"
100,Ciel,"I said what I said.
You know what I mean, right, Shiki?"
110,Shiki,"Ciel, could you please not just deflect
to me when you can't take the heat anymore?"
120,Arcueid,"Hey, Shiki, what did she even mean by 'dim'?
You know, don't you?"
130,Shiki,"Well, you know how if you turn on the lights during daytime,
they look a little dim?"
140,Arcueid,Yeah?
150,Shiki,"And, you sometimes let off light when you get angry, right?"
160,Arcueid,"Yeah, I do."
170,Shiki,"So what she's basically saying is, most of the time
you're not letting off any light, making you 'dim'."
180,Ciel,"As always, you understand me completely, Shiki."
190,Ciel,"The vampire doesn't seem to have any self-awareness,
with how she rampages openly during the day."
200,Ciel,"She is no ""moon at mid-day"".
I'd say she's more like a ""dim-bulb at mid-day""."
210,Arcueid,"That's it, I'm killing her!
We'll do a proper best out of ten, alright, Ciel?!"
220,Arcueid,"If you don't like the way I'm talking about you,
I'll show you a whole power plant's worth of light!"
