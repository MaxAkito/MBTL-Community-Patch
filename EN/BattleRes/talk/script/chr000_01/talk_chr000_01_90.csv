10,Ciel,"Urk...!
Even though we only used weapons that
wouldn't damage the neighborhood..."
20,Arcueid,"Urgh...
After walking around all afternoon..."
30,Arcueid_and_Ciel,I can't...finish her!
40,Shiki,"Unbelievable! A double KO at 5 wins each?!
Are you two okay?!"
50,Ciel,...I'm fine.
60,Arcueid,"Me too...and I haven't lost...
But I'm hurt worse than I thought..."
70,Arcueid,"Still...
Why did you hold back at the end, Ciel?"
80,Ciel,"I just realized...that even if I made you rethink things,
it wouldn't really solve anything."
90,Ciel,"I see you two went for a walk in town,
and then had a fight, according to Akiha's schedule."
100,Ciel,"I can't imagine Akiha putting Shiki
in any danger, though."
110,Shiki,"(Hmm, I'm not so sure about that...)"
120,Ciel,"So who drew up the plan?
When I thought that, I had to stop."
130,Arcueid,"Oh...
So it's someone I couldn't predict, huh?"
140,Shiki,"You both suddenly seem content with things...
What's going on?"
150,Ciel,"This is our business. No need to worry your
pretty little head about it, Shiki."
160,Ciel,"And that concludes our business here.
Unless you would like to continue?"
170,Arcueid,"Not a chance.
I've had plenty of you, too, Ciel."
180,Arcueid,"In that case, Shiki, carry me home now. Like a princess.
That's what you do at times like this, right?"
190,Shiki,"Don't get carried away. Anyway,
there's no way I could make it to your apartment."
200,Shiki,"Sorry, Ciel, could you get her other side?"
210,Arcueid,"No, stop!
I'd rather lie down in the street than have Ciel help me!"
220,Shiki,"I could handle a short distance indoors.
But definitely not out here and for so far!"
230,Shiki,"And besides, you'll get better if you just give it time.
Why don't we sit on a bench and rest a bit?"
240,Arcueid,"Today has been really hard on me mentally!
I'm not walking another step!"
250,Ciel,"(Mentally, huh...? I guess the destruction
Å@is pretty light for Arcueid.)"
260,Ciel,"(She was being considerate in her way,
Å@and looking out for Shiki.)"
270,Ciel,"Oh, fine. I guess I have no choice.
I'll bow out of here."
280,Ciel,"My apologies, but I'll leave you to tend to your stray.
Home is in the opposite direction for me. Goodbye."
290,Arcueid,"Wow, she could read the room today.
See you later, Ciel!"
300,Arcueid,"Okay, Shiki! Hurry up!"
310,Shiki,"I give up...okay.
Just to the entrance of your apartment, got it?"
320,Arcueid,"Aww, why not all the way?
It's not much further to my place from there!"
330,Shiki,"It feels different to me!
You're going to lock me in if I go inside, aren't you?!"
340,Arcueid,Hmph. No fair!
350,Arcueid,"Okay, if you can make it to the apartment without
putting me down once, I won't ask for the rest, sound good?"
360,Shiki,"Yeah, that works.
But no getting heavier or squirming, okay?"
370,Arcueid,...Hmph.
380,Shiki,"That's what you intended to do, isn't it?
You're such a child.
Bad girls like that have to walk on their own..."
390,Arcueid,"Okay, okay, I'm sorry! I'll be good, promise!
Please carry me?"
400,Shiki,...
410,Arcueid,"Heeheehee!
And we're off!"
420,Shiki,"Urgh... What am I going to say
if someone from school sees us?"
430,Shiki,"(Never mind that, need to conserve energy.
Å@I'll never live it down if I don't make it the whole way.)"
440,Shiki,"No, no, I made a promise!
That's what's important! The promise!"
450,Shiki,"I don't even understand why Akiha would cry
if I'm not back by evening!"
460,Shiki,"Let's do this! Raaahhhh!
Hang in there, legs and back!"
470,Shiki,"Hey, stop grabbing onto my neck!
You'll make me drop you, idiot!"
