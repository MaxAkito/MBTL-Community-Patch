10,Neco_Arc,"Well, great, another failed route. At least I stopped
counting after the second one so it doesn't hurt as much."
20,Neco_Arc,"The idea of wearing down the two big heroines by having them
fight each other made sense in theory... *meow*"
30,Neco_Arc,"Hmm. Maybe I'm still missing something?
No, in the end it's still the shaky middle section. *meow*"
40,Neco_Arc,"Especially that one with the rose-colored thoughts and eyes.
She went down a bad path all on her own."
50,Neco_Arc,"Hand her the dice and she'll only roll snake eyes.
That's what I get for playing with a former human."
60,Neco_Arc,"Thinking about it, she never rolls enough to level up.
Hehehe... I really chose the wrong glasses, didn't I?"
70,Neco_Arc,"This has delayed both my latest plan, cat-ears-for-everyone,
and my cat-scription investments by a lot."
80,Neco_Arc,"I did everything and anything with my own two paws!
With no production costs, this should have been an easy gain!"
90,Neco_Arc,"Sure, my predicted streaming costs are pretty high.
What even is this ""mental care for content monitors?"""
100,Neco_Arc,"They have flesh of concrete and spirits of steel! I want to
see who's responsible for this. Or not. They scare me."
110,Neco_Arc,I'll be forced to take our 10 year plan and--
120,Akiha_Hatena,That's enough!
130,Neco_Arc,Mya? Who's there?!
140,Akiha,"There you are, you good-for-nothing mongrel!
Cease your pointless resistance and come quietly."
150,Neco_Arc,"Ooh... This oppressive,
yet also noble feeling of being stepped on..."
160,Neco_Arc,"This could only mean that devilishly
terrifying Sister is here!"
170,Neco_Arc,"But I don't mind that hardcore style,
when you knock and unlock at the same time...?"
180,Akiha,"That's enough gross talk from you. And enough breathing too.
I can't let you run wild any longer."
190,Akiha,"And especially!
I won't let this NEXT nonsense happen!"
200,Neco_Arc,"Hmph, and just how do you think you'll stop me?
Get mad, cry, and start glowing like a video game character?"
210,Akiha,"Don't lump me in with some self-proclaimed princess.
I'm far more competent than that."
220,Neco_Arc,Mya ha ha ha!
230,Akiha,"Hehe, I don't know what you're laughing about,
and I'm not going to ask either."
240,Neco_Arc,"Thank you, Sister!
You really are different...from your predecessor."
250,Neco_Arc,"By the way, where were you before?
My kitty sensors didn't detect you."
260,Akiha,"You show up when no one called for you,
but run away when someone hunts for you, right?"
270,Akiha,"So I left everything to servants this time,
and pulled the strings from behind the scenes."
280,Neco_Arc,"What?! How could I have been betrayed like this?!
After we did so much together!"
290,Kohaku,"Indeed, I am Lady Akiha's loyal servant,
and not a mysterious, adorable scientist."
300,Kohaku,"Now, Lady Akiha... Let's get this over with
before she says something unfortunate!"
310,Akiha,"Kohaku, wrap this and set it on the launch pad.
Also, something unfortunate? Care to explain?"
320,Kohaku,"Yes, ma'am!"
330,Akiha,"Hisui, clean this up. I want it spotless."
340,Hisui,"Yes, ma'am! Absolutely!"
350,Akiha,"We're behind schedule. Get it done in five minutes.
Get to work!"
360,Neco_Arc,"I can sense intense leadership and decisiveness...
What are they starting, I wonder? *meow*"
370,Akiha,"You like the stars, don't you?"
380,Neco_Arc,"Oh, am I going to outer space? How many times will this be?
It's really big out here. *meow*"
390,Neco_Arc,"Whoa, it's so bright! Oh, the sun's coming up.
I almost thought I was shooting beams from my eyes. Pew pew!"
400,Neco_Arc,"Space debris... It's all crunchy and tastes metallic.
I love it in the morning, since I'm up too early for humans."
410,Neco_Arc,"Free food and a home in space, I'm really winning!
There's no water, air, or hope of help, though."
420,Neco_Arc,"Oh, wanna know what's in my glass here?
*meow* This is just some cheap 3 billion year old
dark matter."
430,Neco_Arc,"Still, sending me into orbit with a fighting kick...
I guess that means Ciel really did get beaten up?"
440,Neco_Arc,"And have I ever actually said I liked the stars?
Even if I had, that doesn't mean I want to become a star!"
450,Neco_Arc,Hmph. Is this the end of my feline ambitions? *meow*
460,Neco_Arc,"No!
Never! As a cat, I shall meow-ver surrender!"
470,Neco_Arc,"I will be shameless! And suck up! And never pay!
Even the random death earlier wasn't the real end."
480,Neco_Arc,"Can my cat-scription succeed,
without any plan at all?"
490,Neco_Arc,"I think it's a great idea to start weekly,
and then gradually shift over to irregular annual releases."
500,Neco_Arc,"So stay on the edge of your seats for my next broadcast!
And if your hand tries to vote my video down, bite it!"
510,Neco_Arc,"Alright, now I'm going to get focused
and try re-entering the atmosphere!"
520,Neco_Arc,"No matter how many times I do this, I just can't get used
to those 10 thousand degrees at Mach 30!"
