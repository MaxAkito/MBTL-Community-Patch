So you're the one behind this whole vampire mess?
Not really trying to hide it, are you?

You think this smoldering city is my work?
What an unfounded and odd provocation, murderer.

It makes me more mournful than upset.
After all, one cannot stay angry at a fool.

Really now? Hate to break it to you,
but I really don't care what you think of me.

The mere sight of a vampire's almost enough
to make me lose it.

I see. It appears you have a wound you cannot forget,
yet cannot recall either.

How pitiful. It brings you such fury it compels you
to challenge even a Dead Apostle, despite the fact
you are merely human.

I could not turn down such a challenge, now could I?

Come, blood bag.
I shall gratefully accept your scorching blood.

Sorry to disappoint, but what I've got in store for you
is neither warm nor cold. It's simply death.
