10,Kohaku,"Thank you all for coming today to join in this
stamp rally to promote Shiki's good health."
20,Shiki,"Wait, what?
What do you mean a stamp rally for my health?!"
30,Kohaku,"Yes, for whatever reason your lifestyle has failed to improve
and Lady Akiha is quite distressed."
40,Kohaku,"And so, on her behalf,
I have taken it upon myself to oversee your progress!"
50,Ciel,"I see what you're getting at.
I've also been concerned for Shiki's health."
60,Shiki,"Oh, come on.
You really don't need to worry so much."
70,Shiki,"I know what's good for me and what isn't.
Pretty sure I know my own body best..."
80,Kohaku,"Nope! I know you. You think ""good"" means ""surviving,""
and ""bad"" means ""about to die!"""
90,Kohaku,"That's not normal! It's not okay at all!
Place others first too much and it will kill you!"
100,Ciel,"I agree. Well spoken, Kohaku.
You need to take care of yourself, Shiki."
110,Ciel,"And your misguided attempts to do everything yourself
isn't being kind, it's being cruel."
120,Ciel,"If you ever do that again, I'll really get mad at you.
I would have to go powered for that, too, so watch it."
130,Shiki,"G-Got it.
And I'm sorry. I'll try to do better."
140,Kohaku,"Heehee.
It seems you are safe in Ciel's capable hands."
150,Kohaku,"Please make sure to put Master Shiki's health and safety
first."
160,Kohaku,"Stop whatever you're doing immediately if any problems arise,
and I will rendezvous with you if needed."
170,Shiki,"You're staying here, then, Kohaku?
How will you know how I'm doing?"
180,Kohaku,"Heehee, would you believe me if I said
that I can easily sense anything happening to your body"
190,Kohaku,as easily as if you were within reach at any time?
200,Shiki,"Oh, so it's sort of like a doctor's intuition.
Exactly."
220,Kohaku,"There are pleasant surprises along the way,
at the checkpoints and at the goal,"
230,Kohaku,"so be sure to visit each one!
I'm sure you'll have a wonderful time!"
240,Ciel,"I have no problem with this plan, but...
Are you plotting something, Kohaku?"
250,Kohaku,Why! I would never do such a thing.
260,Kohaku,"Lady Akiha would be quite cross with me
if I got up to any mischief toward a guest!\sf000"
270,Kohaku,"Now, please be careful out there!
Have a wonderful day with Lady Ciel, Master Shiki!"
280,Shiki,"She would never plot anything.
Kohaku is a very nice girl."
290,Ciel,"I know that. But sometimes
I get the feeling we don't quite see eye to eye..."
300,Shiki,(Like favorite foods?)
310,Ciel,"Shiki?
Is something on your mind?"
320,Shiki,"No, not at all.
Let's head out!"
