10,Shiki,"This is the spot, but...
It sure is getting cloudy out here, isn't it?"
20,Shiki,"Are we in the wrong place? There's nothing here.
Let's move on to the next place, Ciel."
30,Ciel,"Good idea, Shiki."
40,Ciel,"I have a feeling someone is over there,
but I'm going to assume it's just my imagination."
50,Ciel,"After all, if an Executor fell and became a Dead Apostle,
they would never show themselves out of shame."
60,Dead_Noel,"Oh, I know all about shame! But I won't hear it from
someone who swings a giant sword in a miniskirt!"
70,Dead_Noel,"Oh, I get it. You're trying to act tough!
You're ignoring me because you know I'm cuter!"
80,Dead_Noel,"I'm younger and stronger than you, too!
Aww, I feel so bad for you, poor widdle Ciel!\sf000"
90,Ciel,What was that?
100,Shiki,Uh oh.
110,Shiki,"Let's go, Ciel. It's some new Dead Apostle.
It's best if we just ignore them."
120,Ciel,"Yes, of course, we are finally on a da-- er... *ahem*
Since we're out for a walk together."
130,Dead_Noel,"That's right! Your sweet little interlude ends here!
Allow me to show you the bitter, painful graveyard of love!"
140,Dead_Noel,"Hey, wait a sec!
Don't pretend like I'm not here!"
150,Dead_Noel,"It's not like I want to be here, but I have no choice!"
160,Dead_Noel,"That scary True Ancestor with the intense emotions
ordered me to come and defeat you!"
170,Ciel,Arcueid did?
180,Arcueid,...
190,Arcueid,"I have no reason to let you go,
but I'll spare you if you go after that heavy Executor."
200,Arcueid,"I doubt you'll even slow her down, of course.
But maybe you can annoy her a little?"
210,Arcueid,"If you don't want to, I'll snap your head off
and use you to make a scarecrow."
220,Arcueid,"You want a reward? Shouldn't the fact that
I haven't killed you yet be enough?"
230,Dead_Noel,"...So, since she threatened me like that,
of course I'm doing what she said!"
240,Shiki,"Arcueid said that?
Something must have put her in a bad mood..."
250,Ciel,"Did she eat something bad or something?
I don't know about that..."
260,Ciel,"I've never heard of her using Dead Apostles
to do things for her before."
270,Ciel,And who is she calling heavy?!
280,Dead_Noel,"D-Don't get mad at me!
I'm just the messenger!"
290,Ciel,"Okay, fine. I think interrogating her
would go faster than asking Arcueid."
300,Dead_Noel,"What? It sounds like 'heavy' suits you pretty good!
Throwing your weight around to bully people!"
310,Dead_Noel,"You think you can bully me into talking,
but that's not happening!"
