10,Arcueid,"Argh! Shiki, you're late!
Did you stop for food? For curry?!"
20,Ciel,Shiki?
30,Shiki,"How could I possibly be late?
I never made any plans with you, Arcueid!"
40,Arcueid,"You did too!
I got a message from your maid!"
50,Arcueid,I've been waiting since ten!
60,Shiki,"Oh. So the surprise Kohaku mentioned
must have meant..."
70,Ciel,"I'm sure she did it without knowing what Arcueid's like,
but your maid sure likes to live dangerously!"
80,Shiki,"Which means, you've been waiting since last night...
Even if it's Kohaku's fault, I apologize."
90,Shiki,"But surely you must have realized at some point?
I can't tell if you're very patient or very impatient."
100,Ciel,"Or her sense of time may have been broken
when she died before."
110,Ciel,"Well, I'm not sure that her sense of time
was ever accurate to begin with."
120,Ciel,"More importantly, she sent Noel after me
so it seems she's gotten way more nasty."
130,Arcueid,"Noel?
Who's that?"
140,Shiki,"You know, the one you threatened and sent to... Er, wait.
I mean the weak Dead Apostle.
I don't like bullying, you know."
150,Shiki,"(Arcueid is probably the only person who would think
Å@Ms. Noel was ""weak,"" though...)"
160,Arcueid,"Huh? Who's that? Shiki, you're the only
person I bother to threaten."
170,Ciel,"It doesn't seem like she's playing dumb...
But just to be safe, I guess we should interrogate her."
180,Arcueid,"Oh, you want to try me?
Fine! I could use the exercise."
190,Arcueid,"But I've been bored for so long,
I might not be able to hold back!
Be sure to surrender when you run out of luck, Ciel!"
