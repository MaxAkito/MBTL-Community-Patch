10,Arcueid,"Okay! Enough!! It's no fun
fighting you anymore, Ciel!"
20,Arcueid,"You just bounce away whenever I get close!
Just surrender already!"
30,Ciel,"That's my line!
You surrender!"
40,Ciel,"How can you have been here all day,
and still have the energy to fight like that?!"
50,Shiki,"Okay, enough! Enough!
Are you two okay?!"
60,Arcueid,"I'm not okay at all!
My head is spinning!"
70,Ciel,"Me too...
I don't think I can move a muscle..."
80,Arcueid,"Good. You can just stay there and let
the Dead Apostles eat you for all I care."
90,Shiki,"Don't be silly. If the dead ate people,
then that would be your job, Arcueid."
100,Shiki,"Naturally, but thanks to you
that isn't a problem."
110,Arcueid,"Hmph.
I really don't like that side of you, Shiki."
120,Arcueid,"Ciel, I'll let you borrow Shiki for today,
so I leave the rest to you, okay?"
130,Ciel,What do you mean by that?
140,Arcueid,"What, are you so happy you can't think straight?"
150,Arcueid,"You'll figure it out,
if you think about why we fought."
160,Ciel,Oh! So the woman Noel mentioned was...
170,Arcueid,"I hate to say it but, my lookalike.
I guess we do look a bit alike."
180,Arcueid,"But I want nothing to do with her.
So I'll let you handle it, Ciel."
190,Ciel,Oh... is that how it is?
200,Arcueid,"That's how it is.
So, all the best!"
210,Shiki,"???Å@
What was that all about?"
220,Ciel,"Nothing you need to
worry about, Shiki."
230,Ciel,"Never mind all that.
Do you have plans after this?"
240,Shiki,"Not at all. I was planning to hang out with you
until just before my curfew."
250,Ciel,Huh?
260,Shiki,Is there anywhere you'd like to go?
270,Ciel,Yes!
280,Ciel,"With everything that happened, I didn't really
get to do anything for you, even when you were the focus."
290,Ciel,"But I won't stand for that!
I thought ahead and found a nice restaurant for us."
300,Shiki,"Um, is their food really spicy?"
310,Ciel,Er!
320,Ciel,"N-No, it's fine. I've also checked out
a few other places, of course."
330,Shiki,"No, I love spicy food."
340,Shiki,"We've been walking around all day,
so something with a punch sounds good."
350,Ciel,"I-I see.
If you say so, then I guess it's decided."
360,Ciel,"To start with,
let's head to this new place nearby."
370,Ciel,"It's an Indian restaurant with good food and low prices,
so it's perfect for students like us!"
