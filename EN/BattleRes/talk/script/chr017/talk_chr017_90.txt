I'm sorry, Mario. I thought for sure you were 
some corrupt Presbyter who'd gone over the to 
the Dead Apostles' side.

Don't give me that shit, you walking disaster. You 
really think a 12 year-old brat would be getting up
in the corruption business already?

My life's on the goddamn line here.

So why don't you try asking my sister about it?

There's no other weirdo quite as good as her when 
it comes to devising clever ways of getting oneself 
out of problems.

After confirming that Roa had indeed perished,
Executor Ciel chose to remain in Souya.

After that, it appears as if great abnormality 
occurred there, though it could not be observed.

Hm. Some kinda terrifying battle probably took place.
Don't wanna get involved.

I think we can chalk this one up as a win.
\l

/*-auto-*/\\@VOICE_PLAY@<0, "08Noe/Noe07_0031", 100>
Noel
I mean, we beat back the True Ancestor, exterminated 
Roa, and drove off that Magician, too. Ciel even got 
herself a new apprentice!

Mario
Got a feeling it's just the 
beginning of a long road ahead...

Mario
By the way, you're starting over from scratch,
fatass. You're getting a reeducation under me, 
for at least a year.
\l

/*-auto-*/\\@VOICE_PLAY@<0, "17Mar/Mar07_0119", 100>
Mario
I'm gonna fix up you up, attitude 'n all. 
Once we're done with that, I'll assign you
to whatever church you'd like.

/*-auto-*/\\@VOICE_PLAY@<0, "08Noe/Noe07_0032", 100>
Noel
For real? Awesome! Then I want to work 
directly under you, Acting Presbyter!

Please let me live the good life!

*Sigh* And my big prize turns out to be a useless pawn. 
Just coming outta this alive was a huge plus.

Now... Touko Aozaki, the peerless puppeteer. If she turns
out to be of any help, this may not be over after all.

The road Roa paved is still intact.
If I can just see where this thread leads...

It's gonna be real fuckin' annoying but... I have a
