10,Neco_Arc,"With a flash of lightning, the cat finally arrives!
Do not doubt your eyes! This is real."
20,Neco_Arc,"Oh, is this Souya, where the new Tsukihime was set?
Yes, it is."
30,Neco_Arc,...
40,Neco_Arc,"A pleasant place,
where everyone is a model of health."
50,Neco_Arc,"Hello. It is I, your reliable partner,
The elite cat, Neco-Arc."
60,Mash,"I'm her assistant, Mash Kyrielight.
Whoa... This is the capital of Japan in the 2010s!"
70,Mash,"I'm just an inexperienced Demi-Servant,
but I'll do my best! It's good to be here!"
80,Neco_Arc,"Oh, don't get excited over a place like this.
You've still got a lot to learn, partner."
90,Neco_Arc,"Are you one of those people, Mash?
Did you grow up in the north pole, or in a jungle somewhere?"
100,Mash,"No, nothing like that...
I just think it's neat how this is different from
Rayshifting."
110,Mash,"But is this really an evil city
that poses a threat to all cats, Neco-Arc?"
120,Neco_Arc,"Oh yeah. To say it's the meowst evil place
in the world would be an understatement."
130,Neco_Arc,"Ignore me for a decade, huh?! I'm no fancy wine to put aside!
My wrath will haunt them for seven generations!"
140,Neco_Arc,"Got it. So, we're the chosen warriors,
and that's why we're invading the MB universe."
150,Neco_Arc,"And with a powerful new character!
I'm done counting on Tsukihime characters! I'm sick of"
160,Neco_Arc,"palette swaps! Like mecha-maids and a me that smokes...
They intended to betray me from the start!"
170,Neco_Arc,"But you're not like that, Mash.
Your eyes are as clear as the water in a goldfish bowl..."
180,Mash,"Thank you.
I hope I'll be helpful to you, Neco-Arc."
190,Neco_Arc,"Mya ha ha ha... See how pure she is, and how cute?
I guess she's Mash after partly clearing the game."
200,Neco_Arc,"So, time to crush them without mercy.
Mash, try knocking over a building."
210,Neco_Arc,"You can do that, right?
You're always saving the world and all that, right?"
220,Mash,"S-Sure!
Mash Kyrielight, ready for action!"
230,Mash,"This shield is the foundation of humanity.
Without a doubt, It'll destroy any evil 
that threatens human history!"
240,Neco_Arc,Eeeaaagh?!
250,Mash,"What?!
Why did my Round Shield go after you?!"
260,Neco_Arc,"Ah ha ha. Uh, maybe being in the big city for the first time
made it nervous?
Let's not throw that around me anymore, though."
270,Neco_Arc,"Oh well, I'll just topple the building with my beam.
Mash, you be the tank and protect m-"

but seriously, Ciel, this is like the French Revolution!"
