10,Neco_Arc,"Argh, every single one of them easily
Shield Countered me!"
20,Neco_Arc,"So this is a modern game system...
Simple beams don't cut it, huh?"
30,Neco_Arc,"And meow, this city is still crazy."
40,Neco_Arc,"They just see a cat and think it's an easy win!
I can't even buy anything at the convenience store!"
50,Mash,"I'm back, Neco-Arc!
I got you canned cat food, oden, and veggie juice."
60,Neco_Arc,"Oh, danke schon, mademoiselle.
How was the convenience store of your dreams?"
70,Neco_Arc,"They're not like that out in the countryside, right?"
80,Mash,"Oh yes, it was very exciting!
There were so many fancy products, and it was warm inside...!"
90,Mash,"I'm going to suggest all that to the cafeteria
next time I'm back at Chaldea!"
100,Neco_Arc,"You should! We don't have them in my kingdom, either,
so I totally get that. *meow*"
110,Neco_Arc,"But that's because we cats are whimsical beings.
The concept of prices is too complex for us. *meow*"
120,Neco_Arc,"Anyway, time to crack open the cat food.
Mash, do you have a can opener? No?"
130,Neco_Arc,"Oh, well. Guess I'll just eat the whole thing. I certainly
won't find any sharp objects in this peaceful little park."
140,Mash,"I see...wait,
watch out, Neco-Arc!"
150,Mash,"Is this a throwing dagger?!
Where did it come from?!"
160,Neco_Arc,"Ho ho! A silent triple projectile attack coming from
above, eh? Thank you super cats, welcome to the stream!"
170,Neco_Arc,"But it's not my birthday today,
it's not the day to showcase you, either!"
180,Neco_Arc,"Show yourself, Ciel!
I know you're up above the streetlights!"
190,Neco_Ciel_Hatena,"You know my name?
So you're not just any NECO."
200,Neco_Ciel_Hatena,"And that girl beside you...
She's clearly from another universe."
210,Neco_Ciel_Hatena,"Answer me. How did you come to this world?
What purpose do you have here?"
220,Neco_Arc,"Well, if I knew how I got here,
my life would be a whole lot easier."
230,Neco_Arc,"The only one allowed to pick on me
is Miyako."
240,Neco_Arc,"I dozed off at home, and when I woke up
this armored girl was there, looking anxious."
250,Mash,"Yes. I was completely lost,
and Neco-Arc encouraged me to keep going."
260,Neco_Arc,"See? I'm a good kitty!
And I'm really cute, most of all. And mighty and brave."
270,Neco_Arc,"On a very basic level, my whole concept is different from
someone who, oh I don't know, goes ""powered"" or something."
280,Neco_Arc,"And who ever heard of a murderous heroine with
heavy weaponry and a guillotine blade? *meow*"
290,Neco_Ciel_Hatena,"Quite the thrill-seeker, aren't you?
Well then, as you wish. I'll calmly deliver your punishment.
Hya! (Å™)"
300,Neco_Arc,"(You idiot, you fell for it!
Å@I'm not scared of you on the ground!)"
310,Neco_Arc,"(My claws are going to turn that sexy outfit
Å@into an avant-garde shredded design!"
320,Neco_Ciel,"*shuffle* (Å´). Prepare yourself, you defect!
There is no place for you in this city!"
330,Neco_Arc,"...
Huh?!"
