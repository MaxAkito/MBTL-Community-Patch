10,Neco_Arc,"It's a bit late now, but allow me to introduce myself.
I'm Neco-Arc. I still don't have a scientific classification."
20,Neco_Arc,"I could be a projection of viewers wanting a happy ending,
another side of the princess of the True Ancestors,"
30,Neco_Arc,"an accidental doodle that came to life
as an embodiment of quantum wave functions,"
40,Neco_Arc,"or something else. I'm a mysterious god-cat.
Honestly, I don't even know myself."
50,Mash,"Even you don't know?
Doesn't that bother you?"
60,Neco_Arc,"Well, I can't get a credit card, which is inconvenient but
probably for the best. I have an old driver's license though."
70,Neco_Arc,"And besides, all self-aware beings share the issue
of not knowing who they truly are."
80,Neco_Arc,"There's meowthing to gain from thinking about it.
I've decided that about everything, from birth to death."
90,Mash,"Hehe, you're tough, Neco-Arc.
Despite your terrible battle diagrams."
100,Neco_Arc,"Hehe...thank you for the genuine respect.
Everything you say is so naturally tasty, Mash."
110,Neco_Arc,"But you shouldn't always put such a positive spin on things.
You gotta make your mark, not just stoke the fire in others!"
120,Mash,"S-Sorry. You're right.
I should have said rated zero, not just 'terrible'!"
130,Mash,"You're doing your best despite not having
been in a tournament for almost 20 years!"
140,Neco_Arc,"Okay, stop! You'll kill me before we reach the boss!
I'll end up getting sucked into this brutal world!"
150,Neco_Akiha_Hatena,"This is literally the most annoying thing possible.
This is why western pseudo-vampires are lame."
160,Neco_Arc,"Oh! This incomparably chilly, cool voice,
that suspects all cats and looks down on her brother!"
170,Neco_Akiha_Hatena,"I'm sure you asked for it, but if you're going to be killed
by an ally, I'd rather you did it in a back alley out of sight
somewhere."
180,Neco_Akiha_Hatena,Have a little consideration for the people who live here.
190,Neco_Akiha_Hatena,"No one wants to see a dead mouse
first thing in the morning, do they?"
200,Neco_Arc,"She's here!
Honestly, not much has changed, even after the remake."
210,Neco_Arc,"That's all I'll say about that.
Even cats have mercy for their foes."
220,Neco_Arc,"Hey you, the sister with the perfect body!
Thanks for the awesome boss-type introduction!"
230,Neco_Arc,"Still, even if the lobby is a mess,
it's the servants that clean it all up."
240,Neco_Arc,She doesn't do anything herself.
250,Neco_Arc,"Then when the kid in glasses helps them out,
she's surprised to find they like him more."
260,Neco_Akiha_Hatena,"Hehe.
How unpleasant. It makes me want to crush you under my heel."
270,Neco_Akiha_Hatena,"Listen, I'm done with rude invaders
and inconsiderate self-styled princesses."
280,Neco_Akiha_Hatena,"As the master of this city,
I will be the one to punish outsiders!"
290,Neco_Akiha,"The time has come to know your own weakness.
You're only two heads tall, do you think you can beat me?"
300,Mash,...
310,Neco_Arc,"So that went as expected.
Are these simple cat-versions worth anything?"
320,Neco_Akiha,"What do you mean?
I'm perfect, you said it yourself."
330,Neco_Arc,"I get it. It's as clear as when I give into temptation and
order dessert, despite knowing what it'll do to my body."
340,Neco_Arc,"Still, for me personally,
an entire world of cats sounds like a horror meowvie..."
350,Neco_Arc,"Oh well, time for a cat championship fight!
Here I come, princess-with-the-same-strengths-as-me!"
