10,Neco_Arc,"The rich girl goes down after an earth-shaking battle. It was
a nightmare of a battle, among the worst three in my life."
20,Neco_Arc,"Meowving on, though..."
30,Neco_Arc,This isn't what I was expecting!
40,Neco_Arc,"Beating that tiny, big-headed character
doesn't mean I've reached the pinnacle of MB. Not at all."
50,Neco_Arc,"Just what is going on?!
Where's the real Ciel?! Where's the real Akiha?!"
60,Mash,"Um, I hate to bring this up after
we fought all the way here, but..."
70,Mash,Look at this receipt.
80,Neco_Arc,What is it?
90,Neco_Arc,"""Ultra satisfying! Large three dried sardine bento lunch,
good until December 31, 2021..."""
100,Neco_Arc,"Wait, 2021?!
So... So... So..."
110,Neco_Arc,"We're not in the Tsukihime universe...and...
we're not in the MB universe either!"
120,Mash,"This was a whole other parallel world.
It seems to be different again, in its own way."
130,Neco_Arc,"I see. But meowstakes are part of learning.
I've figured out our general coordinates."
140,Neco_Arc,"If it works the same as it did before, we're right next to
the MB universe now, Mash! Are you charged up on magic?"
150,Mash,"Yes, thanks to your fighting,
my Noble Phantasm is fully charged!"
160,Mash,I'll open a gate!
170,Neco_Arc,"Go, go, go!
Whoa, this is great, it's like surfing!"
180,Mash,"It's a refreshing experience for me, too.
If I had to compare it to something, it's like Zero Sailing."
190,Neco_Arc,"Really? So you always have the thrill of being one mistake
away from falling out of spacetime?! Chaldea sounds amazing."
200,Neco_Arc,"Hm... It might not be a bad idea to get more help
from that hellish service place..."
210,Neco_Arc,"They'd just be pawns for me to use up
until there's nothing left..."
220,Neco_Arc,"Um, mademoiselle? You're a Servant, right?
Can you call others like you?"
230,Mash,"Well, yes..."
240,Mash,"You have a Magic Circuit too, Neco-Arc.
So you should be able to summon a Knight."
250,Neco_Arc,"I've got it.
My plan for victory is coming together!"
260,Neco_Arc,"I'll pick up additional reinforcements,
and head into the true MB universe in full-force."
270,Neco_Arc,"Next episode, Melty Blood$: Type Lumina Brawl Edition!"
280,Neco_Arc,"""No controls, lots of summoning berserkers!
 Huh, is my house on fire?"""
290,Neco_Arc,"Plus, celeb cats!"
300,Mash,"(She's not suitable as a Master, and doesn't have
a Command Spell, but put your trust in Neco-Arc!)"
