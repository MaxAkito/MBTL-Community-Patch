20,Navigate,Rayshift in 3... 2... 1...
30,Navigate,"An error has occurred.
Unidentified spacetime continuity error."
40,Navigate,"Grand Order verification paused.

Forced ejection locked."

return."
70,Hisui,"Was it around here, maybe?
That loud crashing sound earlier..."
80,Hisui,"My sister was probably cleaning, saying"
90,Kohaku,"""We should dust outside sometimes, too.
 Oh, let's make this all pretty!\sf000"""
100,Kohaku,"""Oh ho ho, look at this expensive Imari-ware vase.
 Oh no. My hand slipped!Åô"""
110,Hisui,"and then she dropped Master Makihisa's precious antique
out the window..."
120,Mash,...
130,Hisui,"Oh! A thief...no, someone lost in the grounds?
Oh no, first I've got to see to their injuries!"
140,Hisui,"Kohaku, it's an emergency!
Please come to the west wing garden immediately!"
150,Kohaku,"Calm down, Hisui."
160,Kohaku,"That does look like expensive armor,
but it's not from our collection."
170,Hisui,"Not that.
I meant her injuries, not her armor."
180,Kohaku,"Oh, I see.
I don't see any scratches or bruises;
she's perfectly healthy."
190,Kohaku,"Maybe she's just a little hungry and lethargic?
But that seems to be all."
200,Mash,Ah...
210,Mash,"Where...am I?
Um... Who are you?"
220,Kohaku,"Ah, you're awake.
Good morning, stranger."
230,Kohaku,"We are the servants here, at the Tohno estate."
240,Kohaku,"Hisui here found you unconscious in the garden,
and has been looking after you."
250,Mash,"Oh...thank you for that.
Your name is Hisui, then?"
260,Hisui,"Please don't strain yourself.
You should rest some more."
270,Hisui,"I am Hisui, and this is Kohaku.
Feel free to address us casually."
280,Hisui,"You do seem to be in unusual circumstances...
But may we have your name?"
290,Mash,"Oh, of course. I'm Mash Kyrielight.
I work for the Chaldea Security Organization as a..."
300,Mash,"Oh, I'm sorry... I'm not at liberty to discuss
my work with civilians."
310,Mash,"I apologize. You saved me,
and I can't even answer you."
320,Hisui,"There's no need for that.
In any case, extending a helping hand to"
330,Hisui,"an injured person will not impact us financially.
No need to thank us, we are only doing what's right."
340,Mash,Miss Hisui...
350,Hisui,"Please, just Hisui is fine.
Don't hesitate to ask if you need anything."
360,Hisui,"Although we are only servants,
we have a lot of information."
370,Hisui,"Well, mostly just my sister here.
Although, her methods are nothing to be proud of..."
380,Kohaku,Aw shucks!Åô
390,Mash,"R-Really? In that case,
can you tell me the name of this city, and the decade?"
400,Mash,"I'm seeking singularities...or, well, um..."
410,Mash,"That's it! I'm an elite agent sent to deal with
anomalies in the city that others would think impossible!"
420,Mash,"(I can't talk about my job at Chaldea,
 but I should be able to say that much!)"
430,Kohaku,"My goodness! So she's the person
who puts those fliers in the mailbox!"
440,Kohaku,"""We handle any anomalous issues!
 As well as fast fixes for plumbing and pipes!"""
450,Kohaku,Those fliers!
460,Kohaku,"I wondered what sort of person they might be.
I'm so glad I responded to find out!"
470,Hisui,"Kohaku, again with the wasteful spending.
You'll end up making Lady Akiha angry..."
480,Kohaku,"If the outcome is good it'll be totally fine, Hisui!"
490,Kohaku,"At the very least, this should eliminate some of
Master Shiki's need to act out!"
500,Hisui,"That's definitely true...
Dangerous jobs should be left to specialists."
510,Mash,"There's a dangerous job?
I may be able to help with that."
520,Mash,Can you give me more details?
530,Kohaku,"Yes. The peace of this city has been disrupted
by a couple of vampires."
540,Kohaku,"They don't follow the speed limits, and have no respect
for public decency. They ring bells at night to brainwash
people."
550,Kohaku,"Unfortunately, nights in Souya nowadays
are much like nights during the witch hunts of the past."
560,Kohaku,"This has also dragged down the reputation of this family
here. Will you help us?"
570,Mash,"Of course, Ms. Kohaku."
580,Mash,"As a Heroic Spirit who safeguards human order,
and above all as someone you kindly helped,"
590,Mash,"I, Mash Kyrielight!
Will serve as a wannabe vampire hunter!"
600,Hisui,"Lady Mash... You agreed, even knowing
that my sister was trying to talk you into it, I see."
610,Hisui,"In that case, we must offer our support
with as much sincerity as we can."
620,Hisui,"Do you have what it takes to win, Lady Mash?
With all due respect, allow us to find out!"
