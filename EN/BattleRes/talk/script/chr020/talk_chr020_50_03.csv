10,Mash,"SHEBA's observation function is suspended...?
So this place is probably outside of reality."
20,Mash,"It's somehow separate from the world.
An ephemeral state with no future or past..."
30,Mash,"A ""Reality Marble""...
But there's no sign of magic at work."
40,Dead_Noel,"Who's that? A new visitor?
I don't know her..."
50,Dead_Noel,"If she's talking about magic,
it means I should be careful around her."
60,Dead_Noel,"Which is fine. I'm tired of preying on normal
humans, anyway."
70,Dead_Noel,"Welcome to a world of waking nightmares!
I will awaken you from the nightmare of reality."
80,Mash,"Oh! You must be one of the vampires that live in this city.
You look like a young girl on the outside..."
90,Mash,"but your magic readings are higher than a human's.
You're a Demon or Beast-class threat."
100,Mash,"I show no mercy to walking calamities who feed on people.
We don't need the likes of you in our city!"
110,Dead_Noel,"What, you have a boyfriend here or something?
Oh, that's it! You do, don't you?!"
120,Dead_Noel,"I'll have to make sure to kill him, too!
Couples need to stick together, right?"
130,Dead_Noel,"Isn't that more exciting?!
You trust each other, support each other, and then"
140,Dead_Noel,"in the very end you betray each other! It's delightful!
Artificial sucrose, sweeter than anything natural!"
150,Dead_Noel,"Really, it's all you humans' fault for being so delicious.
I'm tempted to gorge myself until I get fat!"
160,Mash,"That's not true.
I've heard vampires don't grow or have any sense of taste."
170,Mash,"You're just drunk on your own evil.
You're the one who's in for an awakening!"
