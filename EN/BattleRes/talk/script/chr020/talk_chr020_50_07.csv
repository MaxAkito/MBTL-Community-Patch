10,Mash,"To think such a huge cave was under this city...
That altar in the center, and the symbols carved on the floor"
20,Mash,"and ceiling are different from the Animusphere line,
but they're equally complex."
30,Mash,"There's no Mage's Association in Japan.
How are they pulling off such an advanced ritual?"
40,Roa,"Even though you don't know what exactly it is,
you can still appreciate its beauty and complexity."
50,Roa,"Not bad. You pass, girl.
My 14th incarnation studied it as a Stage IV Nightkin."
60,Roa,"Huh? Oh, I see. Your soul is mixed."
70,Roa,"Contemporaneous human and spirit...
something from the past mixed with something alive ""now""."
80,Roa,"Unbelievable...
You really went and experimented that way. Amazing."
90,Roa,"This means you will eventually have to live as a Å°Å°.
A more dreadful fate than a Dead Apostle's stolen eternity."
100,Mash,"Are you the one in charge of this underground place?
I had heard you were a vampire, so..."
110,Roa,"Perhaps you imagined a vicious monster?
No need to worry. I definitely am one."
120,Roa,"I've only just awakened, and am still groggy.
Soon I'll get worked up, and my true self will emerge."
130,Roa,"You should leave while you still can.
I have no desire to taste a false Heroic Spirit's blood."
140,Mash,"No...
I'll leave after I've beaten you."
150,Mash,I know someone like you.
160,Mash,"Someone intellectual yet passionate,
who was wise, yet tried to do something very wrong."
170,Mash,"I am a Demi-Servant of Chaldea,
Mash Kyrielight."
180,Mash,"I faced the first Beast before,
and now I will face you."
190,Roa,"Yes, I like that look, go ahead and scream at me.
And now let's start your healing process...with death!"
200,Roa,"It'll be the greatest medical procedure of the century,
but I'll do it for free!
That shield alone will make up for it!"
