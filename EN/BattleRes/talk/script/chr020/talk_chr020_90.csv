a gate opened up right under my feet."
20,Mash,"And then I fell into a strange place...
There I met Ne... uh, Ne... Huh?"
30,Mash,"That's so weird, I can't remember her name...
But she was a strangely reassuring presence."
40,Mash,"We went to several different universes together,
and in the end there was a tournament."
50,Mash,"She said it was a ""Foreordained Battle of Old vs New,""
I remember that much..."
60,Mash,"But, wait. How did it end?
Well...hehe, that's a secret."
70,Mash,"I'll save that story for a special time,
so be patient."
80,Mash,"We fought in several universes, all centered
around Souya, a city in Japan."
90,Mash,"Looking back on it, it was a lot of fun.
It was a very profound experience!"
100,Fujimaru,"I see. Welcome back, Mash.
It's good to hear you had many adventures."
110,Mash,"Yes! This is Mash Kyrielight,
returning to duty safely after a tour of multiple worlds!"
