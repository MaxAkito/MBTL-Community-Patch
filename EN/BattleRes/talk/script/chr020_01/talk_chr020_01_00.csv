return."
70,Mash,Uh...huh?
80,Mash,"Where...am I?
Doesn't seem like a singularity..."
90,Neco_Arc,"And when the girl came out of the tunnel,
there was Great Cat's Village, as far as the eye could see..."
100,Neco_Arc,"Just kidding! That sort of artsy opening
doesn't suit me at all!"
110,Neco_Arc,"Good morning, beautiful armored girl."
120,Neco_Arc,"You were recovering in the kotatsu since I don't have a bed.
How are you? Does your butt hurt?"
130,Neco_Arc,"Actually, you seem totally fine.
Your durability seems top-tier,
I bet a kotatsu on the hard ground doesn't even phase you."
140,Neco_Arc,"Okay then. Want a mandarin?
It's from Ehime. It's really good."
150,Mash,"S-Sure, thanks.
Oh...it's so sweet! It's amazing!"
160,Neco_Arc,"Right? Have as many as you like.
They're not poisoned or anything."
170,Neco_Arc,"I'm not going to pull any tricks, *meow*
like saying eating the mandarins means you can't leave."
180,Neco_Arc,"Really, if you want people to visit you,
you've got to win them over with taste, not a curse!"
185,Neco_Arc,She has no idea what she's saying.
190,Neco_Arc,"Give up being a heroine, open a little cafe...!
Boil some noodles with feline finesse and conquer the world!"
200,Mash,"(Makes a face that says ""I see."")"
210,Neco_Arc,"Hmm. I see my Chaos Rush had no effect.
My best efforts produced little result."
220,Neco_Arc,"Great Cat's Village is a spirit village.
Humans sometimes wander in here from the surface."
230,Neco_Arc,"You might be one of those people, come to think of it.
You're an adventurer, but from which world?"
240,Mash,"R-Right, I'm Mash Kyrielight.
I'm a researcher for the Chaldea Security Organization,"
250,Mash,"and the success case for Demi-Servant creation,
after fusing with a Heroic Spirit."
260,Mash,"And you... What world are you from?
I don't think you're a creature from the normal world."
270,Neco_Arc,"Wow, I never would have guessed you were such a comedienne!
The joke is a nice payment for the mandarin."
280,Neco_Arc,"But you're right, there's nothing so beautiful as me on the
normal world! I'm so sexy, I'm the real monster!
Look at me shine!"
290,Mash,"So you mean you're monstrous?
Thank you for the perfect metaphor."
300,Neco_Arc,"Yes. We've only talked for a minute,
and I can already tell jokes don't get through to you."
310,Neco_Arc,"Good to meet you, Mash. I'm Neco-Arc.
The top cat in this town."
320,Neco_Arc,"You need to hurry back to your world,
I bet. *meow* Am I wrong?"
330,Mash,Right. But how...?
340,Mash,"My communications with Chaldea are down,
and I don't know what era this is, either..."
350,Neco_Arc,"Mya ha ha ha.
Worry not, mademoiselle!"
360,Neco_Arc,"I'm sure you have lots of concerns, but would you mind
moving the kotatsu aside? There's a surprise underneath!"
370,Mash,"Huh? The kotatsu?
Alright, here goes... Th-This is...!"
380,Mash,"It looks just like a Heroic Spirit summoning circle!
Were you the summoner, Neco-Arc?!"
390,Neco_Arc,"Yeah. When I did, you fell out of the sky
and I cushioned your landing."
400,Neco_Arc,"My magic got squeezed out of me  
like a sponge (figuratively speaking),
and went into the ground."
410,Neco_Arc,"Cool, right?
Modestly speaking, it's a dimensional gate to other worlds."
420,Neco_Arc,"You could even say...it was a fusion technique,
with your power (weight) plus cat power (a death rattle)."
430,Mash,"I-I'm so sorry!
I had no idea I crushed you!"
440,Mash,"Normally, well, I guess you could say that usually
I'm the shield, or the landing cushion, for others!"
450,Neco_Arc,"Hmm. So you're a defender, Mash?
I see. I get that sense from you."
460,Neco_Arc,"So, all that said and done...
wanna jump in the gate?Åô"
470,Neco_Arc,"You get to go back to your world.
And I get to bring peace to the MB universe."
480,Neco_Arc,"C'mon, let's have an alternate universe adventure!"
490,Mash,"Um, well, I don't..."
500,Mash,"I don't mind helping you, Neco-Arc,
but why me?"
510,Neco_Arc,"Don't try to understand, just accept the cat!
*meow* There is no why, Mash!"
520,Neco_Arc,The reason...
530,Neco_Arc,"Is the will of humanity! Sales!
The demand for more DLC!"
540,Mash,The will of humanity...
550,Mash,"I had no idea your mission was so impressive,
Neco-Arc!"
560,Mash,"I'd be happy to help with that!
I'm still inexperienced, but I, Mash Kyrielight,"
570,Mash,"will serve as your shield and fight for humanity!
I will show no mercy to those who disrupt the world's order!"
580,Neco_Arc,"...
(Not used to pure-hearted humans.)"
590,Neco_Arc,"Well, okay then!
It's like another world, or an F2P game you jump into
without buying."
600,Neco_Arc,"Mash, I hereby name you a new adventurer,"
610,Neco_Arc,"one of the Twenty-seven Cats!
Together, we will defeat evil in the MB universe!"
620,Neco_Arc,"That will give me back my magic,
and let me make another gate!"
630,Neco_Arc,"We can do that a few times to experiment,
and eventually I'll make a gate back to your world!"
640,Mash,"Right! Once Neco-Arc is charged,
we'll rip those evil-doers up like rags!"
650,Neco_Arc,"...
Mash, you're actually kind of scaring me."
