10,Mash,"So this was your destination, Neco-Arc?
It's just like a castle."
20,Mash,"It's all beautifully maintained,
and you can tell a lot of care went into it."
30,Mash,"I'm sure the owner must be lovely.
Someone kind, cheerful, and elegant."
40,Neco_Arc,"Well, more or less."
50,Neco_Arc,"The lady of the house is terrifying to have as an enemy,
but she's fundamentally a good girl from a good home. *meow*"
60,Neco_Arc,"It's her servants who you really have to watch out for.
Be especially careful of the one with the broom- Myahhhhh!"
70,Mash,"Neco-Arc?!
Are you okay?!"
80,Neco_Arc,"Y-Yeah, somehow.
What sort of welcome is this, Ms. Maid?!"
90,Hisui,"My apologies.
That was a frying pan from our kitchen."
100,Hisui,"It slipped from my hand when I was practicing flipping food.
I certainly hope that you don't mind."
110,Neco_Arc,"Oh, I see!Åô
No harm done, if it was an accident!Åô"
120,Neco_Arc,"Now, if you'll excuse me...
I have some business with the proprietor."
130,Hisui,"The master of the house is quite busy at the moment,
and is not accepting visitors. However..."
140,Hisui,It does appear that you have an urgent matter to attend to.
150,Hisui,"If you insist,
I shall arrange a meeting, especially for you."
160,Hisui,"Please come this way for now.
I will show you to the waiting room."
170,Neco_Arc,"Really? Do you have a cat food bar there?
No? Just a drink bar? That's still pretty nice."
180,Neco_Arc,"Anyway, let's go, Mash!
Can't let a chance to get refreshments go by!"
190,Mash,"No, but please be safe.
That maid is dangerous."
200,Mash,"Although it's only a remote terminal, my shield
can access the Near-Future Observation Lens SHEBA"
210,Mash,"and it reads that in one minute,
you'll be dead, Neco-Arc!"
220,Neco_Arc,"Really?
But this wine they welcomed us with is pretty good."
230,Neco_Arc,"The faint grittiness that catches in my throat... If I were
to make a comparison, it's rather akin to being possessed."
240,Neco_Hisui,"Wait, I have been possessed.
Hello. I'm Neco Hisui."
250,Neco_Hisui,"Hehe, I'll have you know, Mash, any maid worth her salt
is able to make any cake into a murder cake."
260,Mash,"Chemicals causing psychological imbalance detected!
Initiating Chaldea-method antidote!"
270,Mash,"I'm so sorry, Neco-Arc!
This is the best way to save you!"
280,Neco_Hisui,"Wow, what amazing judgment.
So that's what you meant by dead in one minute!"
