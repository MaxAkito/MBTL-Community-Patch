10,Mash,"How did this happen?
I got separated from Neco-Arc..."
20,Mash,"And on top of that, I somehow ended up in some
weird underground chamber. Good job, Mash Kyrielight."
30,Mash,"I walked deeper into the woods at the back of the estate,
then saw a woman in a kimono ahead of me."
40,Mash,"I wanted to ask her where the trail was,
and followed her, but now...huh?"
50,Mash,"I can hear someone talking...
It's Neco-Arc...and I wonder who else?"
60,Neco_Arc,"Hm... It could be anyone.
I can't even rule out that it's another me."
70,Neco_Arc,"Maybe I took a punch to the gut in this world,
but in another world it could have been a knee strike."
80,Neco_Arc,"Aren't those both the same? *meow*
Is that okay? Isn't there a more peaceful solution?"
90,Neco_Arc,"It doesn't matter. The key point is the parallel worlds.
Oh, they call it the multiverse theory now?"
100,Neco_Arc,"Mya ha ha! I totally knew that.
But why make it sound cooler? Is it rebranding?"
110,Kohaku_Hatena,"That's not relevant.
And the multiverse theory isn't copyrighted."
120,Neco_Arc,"So, nothing to do with shady multinational corporations?
That sucks."
130,Neco_Arc,"But you claim I'm ""proof"" of this multi-whatever.
A ""multiversal duplicate"", even."
140,Neco_Arc,"Well, you've got me there. If you noticed that,
then I guess I can't say you're wrong."
150,Neco_Arc,"A ""miscast that distorts the world with her presence""
you say...? Hmph.
You seem to have a good grasp of the way of cats..."
160,Neco_Arc,"So.
What exactly does that mean?"
170,Kohaku_Hatena,You could become a solvent for the world.
180,Kohaku_Hatena,"You're a foreign body here,
you can't be protected by the laws of this world.
You're frail. You couldn't beat anyone in a fight."
190,Kohaku_Hatena,"But you're also unrestricted by fate.
Your vision is fuzzy in a good way,"
200,Kohaku_Hatena,"letting you see into the neighboring universe
while you're in this one."
210,Kohaku_Hatena,"Try to imagine it. What would happen if
one can of cat food had the contents of two cans?"
220,Neco_Arc,"Huh? That sounds bad.
I guess...it would explode?"
230,Kohaku_Hatena,No. Fusion would occur.
240,Kohaku_Hatena,"The fate tied to heroine A,
and the fate tied to heroine B..."
250,Kohaku_Hatena,"They would mix, and both could coexist.
This is a route where no one gets hurt!"
260,Kohaku_Hatena,"If you keep pining and pining over Shiki until
you burn yourself up, or...!"
270,Neco_Arc,"Burn myself up?! Give me-ow a break... But, and
I'm putting this nicely, that kind of world would be trash!"
280,Mash,"I can't quite make what they're saying...
But the sense of danger is incredible,
like I'm dealing with a doomsday device."
290,Mash,"But should I really keep listening in on
a private conversation?
Yeah, I should wait until they're done... Ah!"
300,Kohaku_Hatena,Who's there?!
310,Neco_Arc,Wh-Who is it?
320,Mash,Mya-- Ahhhhh!
330,Neco_Arc,"Oh, it's just one of my fans.
Don't worry, *meow* let's just continu- AHHH?!"
340,Kohaku_Hatena,"The camphor powder may be a shock, but it's harmless.
Please remember to clean up later!"
350,Neco_Arc,"Ohh... WHOOAAAA!
What is this? *meow* I feel so healthy!"
360,Neco_Arc,"I'm filled with mysterious nutrients!
It's like I've been reborn!"
370,Neco_Kohaku,"Oh. I have been reborn.
Hello. I'm Neco Kohaku."
380,Neco_Kohaku,"That stuff just now was a super vaccine
that sends all viruses running."
390,Neco_Kohaku,"But don't worry! *meow*
I'm perfectly fine."
400,Neco_Kohaku,"So don't punch me in the stomach to make me puke.
Please help me peacefully, Mash."
410,Mash,"Neco-Arc...
I'm sorry..."
420,Mash,"I've detected a drug that causes abnormal physical reactions.
Now initiating the Chaldea-method II antidote!"
430,Mash,"It's too late now, Neco-Arc!
This is the best way to save you!"
440,Neco_Kohaku,"I don't want any painful treatments!
Some doctor you are!
Where did you get your medical license?!"
