10,Mash,"Okay, thanks to your help, Neco-Arc,
my Noble Phantasm is fully charged!"
20,Mash,I'll open a gate!
30,Neco_Arc,"Okay, so that MB universe was basically just the MB world
but instead it was a nightmarish world of cats."
40,Neco_Arc,"But I'm not losing hope, giving up, or hanging up.
Cause cats are always seeking the door into summer!"
50,Mash,"Hehe.
You're such a romantic."
60,Neco_Arc,"Hee hee. Oh, stop. I'm merely judging the protagonist
on how kind they are to cats."
70,Neco_Arc,"Anyway, Mash?
How about that exit? Have you found one?"
80,Mash,"Yes. According to SHEBA,
the closest one is about 40 seconds away.
Looks like we're heading into a parallel world."
90,Mash,"Intra-gate travel is stable.
This too is all thanks to you, Neco-Arc."
100,Mash,Chaldea's technology can't do this sort of thing.
110,Neco_Arc,"It's a fusion technique, Mash. It's fusion! Nothing's
stronger than believing in each other! Joining hands!"
120,Neco_Arc,"We're comrades now.
We're going to fix the MB universe together!"
130,Mash,"Right!
We'll have no mercy for those who tear down human order!"
140,Mash,"I, Mash Kyrielight, am ready for whatever
conclusion awaits us! My heart is made of steel!"
150,Neco_Arc,"Hehe, you're so tough!
You're a real angel of justice."
160,Neco_Arc,"Can you all see the punchline that's coming?
Oh yeah, I have a bad feeling about this! *meow*"
