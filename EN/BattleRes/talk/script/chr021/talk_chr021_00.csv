10,Neco_Arc,"So I draw the summoning circle with chalk...
like so."
20,Neco_Arc,"Well, it looks like a paw-print,
but it's more or less correct."
30,Neco_Arc,"Alright, here goes! Life is about crashing and
error analysis!"
40,Neco_Arc,"Close, close, close. Huh? There's some alternate meaning
here, but I don't get it!"
50,Neco_Arc,"Whatever, come on already! Grace me in your beneficence,
guardian of the heavenly scales!"
60,Ushiwaka,"Servant, Class Rider. I, Ushiwakamaru,
have answered your summons."
70,Ushiwaka,"That is my true name before I became Kuro Yoshitsune,
but my skills are no less for it."
80,Ushiwaka,"I will bring you victory, no matter the army you face. I will
take their general's head and end the battle definitively."
90,Ushiwaka,"But... that all goes without saying.
It is good to see you again, Mash."
100,Ushiwaka,"If you summoned me using the Round Shield,
then I can only guess what strange land this is..."
110,Neco_Arc,...
120,Ushiwaka,...
130,Neco_Arc,If I may ask...are you my pen pal?
140,Ushiwaka,"What the hell are you? Some kind of fox,
or a nekomata cat spirit?"
150,Ushiwaka,"It matters not. Where did you get that shield?
Your life depends on the answer."
160,Neco_Arc,"Hey, whoa. This lady's crazy! Does she move at the speed
of sound? Her dialogue sounds laggy."
170,Neco_Arc,"But I love how violent she is! Welcome, wild samurai!"
180,Neco_Arc,I'm Neco-Arc. Mash lent me this shield.
190,Neco_Arc,"Mash just ran to the store to get something.
I was bolstering our forces while she was out."
200,Neco_Arc,"Comprende? You get that? Me, friend. Not enemy."
210,Ushiwaka,"So... Mash is nearby. Then I shall sheathe my blade,
but..."
220,Ushiwaka,"Why are you speaking like that? If you summoned me,
you must know the tongue of this land."
230,Neco_Arc,"Uh, well, you know. Just making sure.
It's all good so long as we understand each other."
240,Neco_Arc,"Your name is Ushiwakamaru? Can I call you Waka?
Are you a boy or a girl?"
250,Neco_Arc,"Do you know this is the real world? The law against swords?
What happened to your clothes? Did you have a growth spurt?"
260,Neco_Arc,"Never mind, I'll just check your stats screen later
for all that."
270,Neco_Arc,"Once again, it's a pleasure, Waka.
I'm Neco-Arc, the cat of justice."
280,Neco_Arc,"I know I look like a sad, soggy bun right now but it's not
my true form. As for why I've summoned you here..."
290,Neco_Arc,"I need your refreshing strength to teach the residents
of the horrible MB universe a less--"
300,Ushiwaka,"Demon hunting, is it? Say no more."
310,Ushiwaka,"I didn't see anything. As a shadow of order,
I need only to simply disappear."
320,Ushiwaka,That said...
330,Ushiwaka,"I am no Benkei, and I am not one
to take things so seriously."
340,Ushiwaka,"So this is the Japan of the 21st century I have heard of,
and I can sense a strong foe here..."
350,Ushiwaka,"Nothing could be more delightful.
I must also find Mash..."
360,Ushiwaka,"I was summoned. And so I shall enjoy this world
until I leave it."
