10,Ushiwaka,"I thought this city was nothing but buildings,
but there are places with nice views as well."
20,Ushiwaka,"I like this place. I shall eat that ""convenience store lunch""
Mash gave me."
30,Miyako,"Oh, there's someone here. She's dressed kind of oddly.
Could she be the person from the alley?"
40,Miyako,"""Sometimes there's a person with an eye patch
 or clothes with wings in the alley..."
50,Miyako," But they're basically harmless, so don't call the cops.
 So long as they're just playing around, anyway."""
60,Miyako,That's what Shiki said! And...
70,Miyako,"She's so slender, and her hair is such a shiny black!
It's amazing! She's so pretty!"
80,Miyako,"I should talk to her! Hi! Sorry, can I take a picture
with you?!"
90,Ushiwaka,"Oh, how adorable. I would be happy to."
100,Ushiwaka,"(No, wait. I'm Etherized. I shouldn't be visible
 to normal people...)"
110,Ushiwaka,"Oh well, no need to worry about the little things.
She likely has a talent for perceiving spirits."
120,Ushiwaka,"This way, child. Are you hungry?"
130,Ushiwaka,"I was just about to have lunch, an--"
140,Miyako,Whoaaa!
150,Ushiwaka,What was that?!
160,Ushiwaka,"Watch out! What are you doing?!
I almost drew my blade on you!"
170,Miyako,"You smell like the bad cat! You're not fooling me
with your cool appearance!"
180,Miyako,"You may look like a good person, but I won't
let you get away with working with that cat!"
190,Miyako,"Yes, I'm certain the special training today was
a warrior's trial!"
200,Miyako,"Well, I challenge you to a duel! En garde!"
210,Miyako,"My name is Miyako! Miyako Arima! I'm still in
elementary school, but I'm a bajiquan master!"
220,Ushiwaka,"(Bad cat...? Does she mean that cat spirit?
 This is a problem, she has that right.)"
230,Ushiwaka,"However, I accept this challenge, regardless
of whether that soggy bun is involved or not."
240,Ushiwaka,"You are Miyako, then. You have honor.
You remind me of a wild monk from my past."
250,Ushiwaka,"I cannot reveal my name,
but you may call me Usumidori."
260,Miyako,(Usumidori?! That's such a pretty name!)
270,Ushiwaka,"It is impressive that you train at your age.
It was rude of me to take you lightly."
280,Ushiwaka,"I shall fight you with this new bamboo sword I bought.
Let this be a good experience for us both!"
