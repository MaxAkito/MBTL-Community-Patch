10,Ushiwaka,"So this is the manor Miyako spoke of.
It definitely feels imposing."
20,Ushiwaka,"But it doesn't feel like enmi or any other deadly curse. It's
more like the aura of a beast at the bottom of a ravine..."
30,Ushiwaka,"Ahh, this is it. A grand find, as great as any other!"
40,Ushiwaka,"Come forth! I challenge the mightiest warrior
of this manor!"
50,Akiha,Who is making so much noise on a weekend morning?
60,Akiha,"We have a garden, pool, hot spring, and tennis court,
but there is no dojo he--"
70,Akiha,"(Look at her clothes... Is that just her style?
 Or, no, is it? She can't possibly be a real warrior.)"
80,Akiha,"Did you get caught in a storm? I can't think of any other
reason why you'd be beating at my gate."
90,Akiha,"I won't turn back anyone asking for help.
Kohaku, get her a change of clothing."
100,Akiha,You'll catch a cold like that.
110,Ushiwaka,"Fear not. I, Ushiwaka, have run through the woods
in such garb all my life."
120,Ushiwaka,"I have never fallen ill, not once. I am only brought down
when hungry, or when Benkei lectures me."
130,Akiha,"S-So you've always dressed that way?
That seems... Uh, please excuse me."
140,Akiha,"Setting aside the manner of your attire,
I can tell you're of noble birth."
150,Akiha,"So your tastes are your own, and it isn't my place
to comment on--"
160,Kohaku,Mistress Akiha!
170,Kohaku,"Do you think her attire might have a negative impact
of the healthy development of a high school boy?"
180,Akiha,"I shall warn her and explain immediately.
Tight tights and armor are not acceptable here."
190,Akiha,"I don't know who you are, or why you're here,
but we don't make exceptions. Now..."
200,Akiha,"So long as I can see you, your fate is decided."
210,Ushiwaka,"Agh, what is this burning pain?!"
220,Ushiwaka,It isn't magic of any sort. That was purely biological.
230,Ushiwaka,"So you must be divine, or mixed. Clearly, you're
no mere human!"
240,Ushiwaka,"I don't know what has angered you,
but I appreciate your fighting spirit."
250,Ushiwaka,"As I have grown weary of playing around,
so let's make this a close fight!"
260,Ushiwaka,"Now, onward to vanquish demons!
And a tour of Souya along the way."
