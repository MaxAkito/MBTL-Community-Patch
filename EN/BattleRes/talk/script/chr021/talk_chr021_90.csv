10,Akiha,I see how it is. So that creature was responsible for this.
20,Akiha,"Putting aside how we should
drive off that monstrosity..."
30,Akiha,"Once you've broken off things with that, come to our side.
You're not on a grand mission or anything, right?"
40,Akiha,"So you should enjoy the modern world all you like.
You know, get more than a quick tour."
50,Ushiwaka,"You would allow that?! I can be quite troublesome,
if I do say so myself!"
60,Akiha,"It makes no difference taking on one more
strange guest at this point."
70,Akiha,"And you remind me of someone I know.
You're like a dog, kind of, and I love that about you."
80,Akiha,"But I will have to hold you to the dress code.
Kohaku and Hisui, you know what you have to do, right?"
90,Hisui,"Leave it to us. How do you like this ward,
Mistress Ushiwakamaru?"
100,Kohaku,"Oh, nice choice, Hisui! But how about this one instead?"
110,Ushiwaka,A ward...?
120,Arcueid_Arumi,"Thank you all for your support!Åô Now, today I'd like to
introduce a new friend!"
130,Ushiwaka,"Good to meet you! I'm Midoriko Usui, I just transferred
to this school!"
140,Ushiwaka,"My hobby is kendo, and my favorite moves are all strikes to
the face. My dream is to fight a strong foe to the death."
150,Ushiwaka,I intend to master surfing at the beach on weekends.
160,Ushiwaka,"I'm still getting used to this era,
but I hope we all get along!"
170,Students,Woww!!!
180,Arcueid_Arumi,"She's obviously a Servant, but with that uniform on there's
no mistaking her as a student!"
190,Arcueid_Arumi,"You like fighting, right? In that case, there's someone
in the next class with glasses..."
200,Arcueid_Arumi,"Who looks quiet but actually has pretty sharp skills.
Let's go pick a fight with them!"
210,Ushiwaka,"Yes, let's! I was worried I wouldn't fit in,
but student life sounds promising!"
