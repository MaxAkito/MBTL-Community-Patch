10,Edmond,"Hope for rescue, and long for revival! Crying out, amidst
bottomless despair!"
20,Edmond,"It's horrible! Indescribable! Indistinguishable from
a modernized hell!"
30,Edmond,"But that warrants my presence still more!
Hear me, denizens of Hades!"
40,Edmond,"I am King of the Cavern! Edmond Dantes, King of the Cavern!
I have emerged from the pit to rescue a woman!"
50,Neco_Arc_Namamono,"Whoa, I was just experimenting and he really came!
That's two Servants, now!"
60,Neco_Arc_Namamono,"I conquered my own desires and offered up three cans
of food from my stash. I'm unstoppable, meow!"
70,Neco_Arc_Namamono,"And you look really tough! What's your Class?
What's the Rarity floating above your head?"
80,Edmond,"Even foreign lands cannot extinguish my flames!
I am an extra class Avenger!"
90,Neco_Arc_Namamono,"Ow! Hothothot! Cool it with the flames a bit, Avenger!"
100,Neco_Arc_Namamono,"We need you to use that excess power later!
Hold onto it for when you fight the surprised-face kid!"
110,Edmond,"My work requires haste. But all time passes in a flash,
for me."
120,Edmond,I will simply search tirelessly and thoroughly.
130,Edmond,"Wait. Have hope. The bell of the night calls for rescue,
and calls to my flames!"
140,Neco_Arc_Namamono,"Hmm. And once again, I have no control.
Are all Servants berserkers?"
