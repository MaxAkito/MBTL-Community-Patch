10,Edmond,"This is...shadow stitching with a Black Key.
What an old trick."
20,Edmond,"A strong fighter; odd amid this chaos.
What were you doing, executor? Selling indulgences?"
30,Ciel,"Money can't buy forgiveness. Namely, because no one
would pay for that in this country."
40,Ciel,"I can relate to being completely fed up, though.
I only just got here a month ago, myself."
50,Edmond,"I see... I rescind my prior statements. They were not meant
for one in honorable poverty."
60,Edmond,"This city can be saved. If there is a woman like you here,
it can."
70,Edmond,"I will not halt your atonement.
Do not stand in the way of my work."
80,Edmond,What do you say? It is a fine deal for the both of us.
90,Ciel,"Unfortunately, I can't take it. Whoever you are,
I can't let you run wild any longer."
100,Ciel,"I can feel the lord's grace in your flames.
I'm sure you're a true believer."
110,Ciel,"Normally I would eliminate you without a word, but I will
grant you the chance to repent given your prayers."
120,Ciel,"Tell me your name, spirit.
Let me lay your struggles to rest."
130,Edmond,Heh...
140,Edmond,Heh... Hehe... Hehehehehe!
150,Edmond,"A truly fearsome iron maiden! You cross over into the realm
of the dead for me, not for your faith!"
160,Edmond,"You give yourself up to burn, and not for vengeance,
as you lose everything..."
170,Edmond,You impress me. But you have picked the wrong foe!
180,Edmond,"The gates of heaven are out of your reach.
I am the embodiment of vengeance, an avenger!"
190,Edmond,"You, who can only die by flames! I have the advantage
here, executor!"
200,Ciel,"It would seem that way. Your flames are of the Assembly
of the Eighth Sacrament. They cleanse away sins."
210,Ciel,"But I've already tasted them. The pain won't damage
my earthly body."
220,Ciel,"You speak of the savior on the mount, spirit.
Well, let me end your pilgrimage here!"
