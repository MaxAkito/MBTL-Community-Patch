10,Roa,"Oh, come on, another Servant?!
This world has absolutely no security!"
20,Edmond,...
30,Roa,"Still, although you're an interloper, you're also a rarity."
40,Roa,"In particular, you seem to be like me, a brutal anti-hero.
I can see it in your eyes."
50,Roa,"How about it? Let go of all that work on self-control,
and aid me in this ceremony."
60,Roa,"Heroic Spirits and Dead Apostles have the same goal,
in the end. 'A final answer to this world.'"
70,Roa,"Countless fools have destroyed themselves attempting the
challenge. It's proving quite the quandary."
80,Roa,"If it goes well here, if someone eventually gets it.
It's so promising, it's tantalizing, isn't it?"
90,Edmond,"If you say as much, it must be true. You, a peerless
theologian and scholar of the heavens."
100,Edmond,"However! Even while I may respect your efforts,
there is still no way I can allow you to get away!"
110,Edmond,"Michael Roa Valdamjong! No matter which world we meet in,
you are my enemy!"
120,Edmond,"How droll! I can barely contain my laughter.
You still dare to meddle in my work!"
130,Roa,"Why do you talk like that? Are you perpetually
stuck in the 18th century or something?"
140,Roa,"This is the problem with people! How do you enjoy living
when you're trapped in the past?!"
