That's a wrap!
Let's keep going! ♪

That was meowwy easy!

WinMes02:
chara_type 103
Sorry, but you never had a chance of winning.
Maybe try again in your next life.
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 102
Still not giving up? Fine...
I'll just have to break you a little more 
savagely next time. You know, as a vampire should.
\e

WinMes04:
chara_type 102
Why don't I drink your blood? Very funny. 
I would appreciate it if you didn't mistake 
me for those other third-rate vampires.
\e


WinMes05:
chara_type 104
Not bad. I had to get a little serious there.
I'll look forward to next time, if there is one.
\e


WinMes06:
chara_type 104
Perhaps I've stayed out in the sun too long. 
You were so weak... The fact that this even qualified 
as a fight must mean my performance is dropping.
\e

WinMes07:
chara_type 103
Oh, done already? 
Not as strong as you look, are you?
\e

WinMes08:
chara_type 100
Ahh, that felt great! ♪
Like that feeling you get standing under 
a blue sky after deflecting a missile, you know? 
Not that I've ever done that. 
\e

WinMes09:
chara_type 100
You wanna go again? 
It was pretty fun, but if we're doing 
one more I'll hand your ass to you!
\e

WinMes10:
chara_type 103
Sometimes I just don't understand you people.
Why do you continue to throw your lives away
when you know you can't win?
\e

WinMes11:
chara_type 102
Jump, turn around, throw a punch, and it's over.
Hmmmm, is this what dancing at a ball is like?

Heheh. So, impressed or what?
Even if you get serious, Shiki, I'm not losing again ♪

WinMes13:
chara_type 103
You may have just became an Ancestor, 
but you should still know some manners.
Otherwise it reflects poorly on the 
sire who bequeathed you their Principle.

WinMes14:
chara_type 100
You're getting sharper by the day.
Shiki might be bothered by it, but
I'm happy to have more playmates.

WinMes15:
chara_type 101
Ugh, how annoying. It never ends!
Just go away already, Ciel.
Keep this up, and the casualties 
won't stop at just you.

// 対ロア
WinMes16:
chara_type 103
Farewell, my very first! Were you satisfied?
Not only did I spill your blood this time,
but I tore you apart completely, soul included!
\e

// 対軋間
WinMes17:
chara_type 103
You're... an old mixblood from this land?
There's some human mixed in, but the quality of 
your blood is on par with a Phantasmal Beast. 
How do you maintain that?!
\e

// 対武装シエル
WinMes18:
chara_type 102
Oh c'mon! Don't get all serious ahead of me!
I'm still just a graceful little vampire!
I'm not gonna go berserk thaaat easily!
