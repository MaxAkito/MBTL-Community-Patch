How tedious you are...
My superiority has been clearly demonstrated. 
There's no need to continue this any further.
\e

WinMes01:
chara_type 1
That was enjoyable. I would gladly serve
as your opponent if ever there is a next time.
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 102
Would you look at that. I fight quite well, after all. 
It appears it won't even prove necessary for me to Invert.
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 101
The battle has been decided. 
You will find the exit over there. 
I suggest you use it while you're still alive.
\e

WinMes04:
chara_type 101
Ooh, you look dissatisfied. 
Do you perhaps wish to try again? 
The outcome will remain the same for all eternity, however.
\e

WinMes05:
chara_type 0
That will have to do.
Hah, perhaps I acted a bit immodestly?
\e

WinMes06:
chara_type 104
Battle isn't about power. 
It's about having technique and a keen mind. 
I'm sure you've grasped that well enough by now.
\e

WinMes07:
chara_type 1
How silly of me.
Just what was I thinking of gaining 
from proving my superiority like this?
\e

WinMes08:
chara_type 2
Thank you. This has proven a great diversion.
Would you perhaps consider serving as my 
opponent once a week or so? How about it?
\e

WinMes09:
chara_type 102
How was it? I only started practicing my dance moves
recently, but I think I'm learning quickly.
\e

WinMes10:
chara_type 1
Oh dear, those injuries look nasty. Don't worry, 
I'll have someone see to your wounds right away. 
Oh, but be careful. She has a habit of over-medicating.
\e

WinMes11:
chara_type 2
Well, that was a productive use of my time.
Do take care.

See, Shiki? I am quite able in battle too,
am I to put my mind to it. Promise to ask me 
for help the next time you need it, understood?

Why do you keep leaving the mansion without permission?!
This is the last time! For now, you'll have to spend some 
time on a secluded island until you've reflected on your actions!

This goes without saying, but you two understand that 
you'll be receiving a pay cut for this, right? At minimum.

Kohaku, I will tolerate your outrageous behavior no longer! 
You will take down the surveillance cameras you've installed 
and destroy your questionable medicine immediately!

For what it's worth, you're a daughter of the Arima family, 
no? Once you're in middle school, you'll be attending 
Asagami Academy, so make sure you act more refine--
What? You don't plan on attending Asagami Academy?!

Three wins isn't bad. 
This is proving to be quite the useful training session.
\e

WinMes10WinStreak00:
chara_type 2
Ten wins?! That's amazing! *ahem* Excuse me. 
What I meant to say was, you would be most 
welcome at our mansion should you be so interested.
