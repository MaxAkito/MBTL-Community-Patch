You wanna go again? I'm game,
but you should probably quit
while you still can.
\e


WinMes01:
chara_type 103
Wow, thought I was a goner there.
Guess that's what I get for going easy on you.
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 1
You're alive, right?
See, all things that are alive eventually die.
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 101
I'm getting out of here.
I can only fight for so long before I get anemic.
\e

WinMes04:
chara_type 3
You had fun? Good for you.
Personally, I'm totally beat.
Try to be a bit more considerate next time.
\e

WinMes05:
chara_type 1
Sorry, but I've got places to be.
I'll call an ambulance for you.
You can reflect on what you did in your hospital bed.

// Something that sounds natural and conveys that he's fucked, basically.
WinMes06:
chara_type 101
Black cats, crows, hearses...
Something about walking under weeping willows, too.
It seems bad luck has cursed the both of us.
\e

WinMes07:
chara_type 1
Try harder next time.
You know how it is these days...
Looks can be deceiving.
Never know what'll turn out to be dangerous.

// �΃A���N�F�C�h Versus Arcueid
WinMes08:
chara_type 103
Whoa! I could've died there!
Would it hurt to hold back for once, Arcueid?!
Stop picking fights just because you feel like it.
\e

// �΃V�G�� Versus Ciel
WinMes09:
chara_type 100
Thanks, Ciel.
I really love how you always go kinda easy on me.
\e

// �ΏH�t Versus Akiha
WinMes10:
chara_type 103
That was real close...
Has she been training in secret or something?
\e

// �΃q�X�R�n Versus Maids
WinMes11:
chara_type 101
Sorry, you two! I promise to head back to the mansion
when I'm done here! I'll make it up to you then!
\e

// ���Ő� Versus Hisui
WinMes12:
chara_type 101
I didn't realize there was a fake Hisui out there.
Still, it doesn't feel right raising a hand against her.
Sorry about that.
\e

// ������ Versus Kohaku
WinMes13:
chara_type 103
You're just a fake Kohaku, aren't you?
I'll have to remember to apologize to the real one
when I see her. Do you mind if we call it a day?
\e

// ���a�� Versus Kishima
WinMes14:
chara_type 1
Who... was that...?
I can't remember...
Almost as if a dream of the past came back to haunt me.
\e

// �ΐq Versus Aoko
// TODO: the "Sensei" is an annoying problem here.
// I think it'd be good if we sat down and came up with some translations for it before merging.
// I don't think a direct TL will do the trick, so "Teach" or something along those lines is off the table.
// Although maybe "Mentor" would work, or something in that direction at least? idk will have to discuss it.
WinMes15:
chara_type 100
And that's all I've learned.
Don't worry, Aoko. I don't always succeed,
but I'll never back out without at least trying.
\e

// �Ε����V�G�� Versus Powered Ciel
WinMes16:
chara_type 100
I've learned a lot from this mock-battle.
I did my best to match my movements with yours,
almost like a waltz. We may have been fighting
against each other rather than together,
but it was fun all the same.

chara_type 103
Three wins already?! I was planning on going home early,
but you don't mind if I stick around a bit longer, right?
\e

WinMes10WinStreak00:
chara_type 0
Ten wins?! That's amazing!
This is getting pretty fun!
Let's keep it up!
