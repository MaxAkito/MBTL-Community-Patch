You wanna go again?
I'm game, but you should probably quit
while you still can.
\e


// TODO: Is this a more jokey "damn thought I was gone for" kinda line,
//       or would something like "Damn, I saw my life flash before my eyes there"
//       work too?
WinMes01:
chara_type 103
Wow, thought I was a goner there.
Guess that's what I get for going easy on you.
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 1
You're alive, right?
See, all things that are alive eventually die.
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 101
I'm getting out of here.
I can only fight for so long before I get anemic.
\e

WinMes04:
chara_type 3
You had fun? Good for you.
Personally, I'm totally beat.
Try thinking about others a little, please.
\e

WinMes05:
chara_type 1
Sorry, but I've got places to be.
I'll call an ambulance for you.
You can reflect on what you've done in a hospital bed.

// TODO: Ask about "It seems bad luck has cursed the both of us."
// Suggestions: "Looks like we're both cursed with bad luck."
//              "Looks like we're both in for a rough time."
// Something that sounds natural and conveys that he's fucked, basically.
WinMes06:
chara_type 101
Black cats, crows, hearses...
Something about walking under weeping willows, too.
It seems bad luck has cursed the both of us.
\e

WinMes07:
chara_type 1
Try harder next time.
Looks can be deceiving, especially nowadays.
Never know who will end up being trouble.
\e

// �΃A���N�F�C�h Versus Arcueid
WinMes08:
chara_type 103
Whoa! I could've died there!
Would it hurt to hold back for once, Arcueid?!
Stop picking fights just because you feel like it.
\e

// TODO: Further edit this line. I don't like it much.
// �΃V�G�� Versus Ciel
WinMes09:
chara_type 100
Thanks, Ciel.
I really love how you always go kinda easy on me.
\e

// �ΏH�t Versus Akiha
WinMes10:
chara_type 103
That was real close...
Has she been training in secret or something?
\e

// �΃q�X�R�n Versus Maids
WinMes11:
chara_type 101
Sorry, you two! I promise to head back to the mansion
when I'm done! I'll make it up to you then!
\e

// ���Ő� Versus Hisui
WinMes12:
chara_type 101
I didn't realize there was a fake Hisui out there.
But fake or not, it doesn't feel right to raise
a hand against her. Sorry about that.
\e

// ������ Versus Kohaku
WinMes13:
chara_type 103
You're just a fake Kohaku, aren't you?
I should definitely apologize to the real one.
You okay if we call it a day for now?
\e

// ���a�� Versus Kishima
WinMes14:
chara_type 1
Who... was that?
I can't remember...
It's almost as if a dream of the past
came back to haunt me.
\e

// �ΐq Versus Aoko
WinMes15:
chara_type 100
And that's all I've learned.
Don't worry, Sensei. I don't always succeed,
but I never go down without a fight.
\e

// �Ε����V�G�� Versus Powered Ciel
WinMes16:
chara_type 100
I learned a lot from this mock battle.
I did my best to match my movements with yours, like a waltz.
We may have been fighting against each other rather than
with each other this time, but it was fun all the same.

chara_type 103
Three wins already?! I was originally planning on
going home early, but you don't mind if I stick around
a bit longer, right?
\e

WinMes10WinStreak00:
chara_type 0
Ten wins?! That's amazing!
This is actually pretty fun!
Let's keep it up!
