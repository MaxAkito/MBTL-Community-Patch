Not bad, weakling. 
Your little performance was far more enjoyable 
than expected. If you make it out of here alive, 
perhaps you should consider joining a circus!
\e

WinMes01:

That left me a bit hungry. You wouldn't mind if I took a
teensy donation of blood, would you? See, I suffer from a
chronic case of anemia, as you might be able to tell.
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 2
One charred corpse coming up! Now all that's left is to 
let the strays in the back alleys have some fun with it!
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 1
And so the battle comes to an end, together with my fun.
You've gotta enjoy the hurting as long as you can, wouldn't
you sa-- Oh excuse me, seems you stopped breathing ages ago.
\e

WinMes04:
chara_type 0
In my gratitude for you in allowing me to enjoy myself, 
I'll do the only humane thing and bury you... Rejoice! 
Not many people have ever had the honor of experiencing 
the hellish sensation of being cremated by lightning.
\e

WinMes05:
chara_type 2
Sorry about that. It took longer than I expected. I would
have liked to send your head rolling with a single attack,
but that actually requires more technique than you'd think. 
Sure makes you respect the samurai of old, doesn't it?
\e

WinMes06:
chara_type 0
Stop moving around, will you? 
Your blood's gonna spill and I don't feel like 
drinking off the ground today. I have to act 
like a proper vampire at least once in a while.

You said that what you and I see aren't the same.
Hah, but they are! At the end of the day,
all they do is just cut things to pieces!
\e

// 対アルクェイド Versus Arcueid
WinMes08:
chara_type 1
So even a True Ancestor can malfunction, huh? 
Just a single scratch, and its worth has plummeted this much.
Right, that must be the sole flaw of a perfect being.
\e

// 対シエル Versus Ciel
WinMes09:

You know you're completely wasting your potential, Sister?
I could've put it to much better use than you...
It really is a damn shame to put an end to someone with
so much talent! Truly a waste!
\e

// 対秋葉 Versus Akiha
WinMes10:
chara_type 1
Hmm...? The sensations in my current body do dampen 
somewhat when I'm fighting this particular girl...
Perhaps it's because of love... perhaps because of lust...
I can't really tell, either way.
\e

// 対吸血鬼 Versus Vampire
WinMes11:
chara_type 0
What an awful night... Wouldn't you agree, 
my fellow vampire? It's a bit depressing, really.
Even the moonlight is too bright for me.
\e

// 対武装シエル Versus Powered Ciel
WinMes12:
chara_type 0
Using the Seven Causes of Death in their split-up form?
I'm not sure what you're so worried about that you'd
hold back like that. Next time you should bring 
out the real deal instead.
\e

// 対志貴(ストーリー専用) Versus Shiki (story only)
WinMesArcadeWin03:
chara_type 1
What a shame. Looks like nothing has changed.
I was hoping that at least YOU would've been able to
cut me apart, alongside this deviation of events...
\e

For you, those excessive weapons are nothing but a shackle.
You've practically put your miraculous body into bondage. 
Indeed, the bondage of human knowledge. 
Before you go condemning other heresies, I think you'd best
come to terms with your own otherwordliness first.

Splendid. I see there will be no lack
of blood to drink with you around.
\e

Hey, you're pretty good! 
Under other circumstances, I would've made you my underling!
