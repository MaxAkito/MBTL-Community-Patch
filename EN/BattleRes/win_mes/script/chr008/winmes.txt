Eeek! ☆ That was a really close one!
I was sooo scared!
There... Those were some good photos!
Now to send these to the Presbyters 
who are sicko enough to like 'em.

You didn't think I'd let you go so easily, did you?
Finding a heathen worthy of pity is harder than
finding marriage material at a speed-dating event.
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 5
What? You expected me to go easy on you? 
Why would I do that when I can barely hold 
my own out here? Are you stupid?
\e

The defeated get sent to the execution room, without exception. 
Though I suppose if your looks are to my liking,
I might be able to show a teensy bit of favoritism.
\e

WinMes04:
chara_type 100
You know an Executor stronger than me?
Sure, whatever. Guess I'll just have to slowly and 
painfully show you what it is that I am better at then.
\e

Lord God Almighty, thy Will is that which I Execute.
Hehe, such a convenient little phrase, don't you think?
\e

WinMes06:
chara_type 101
Mmm... got tomorrow off... what to do...
Damnit, I've energy neither to work on
myself nor to go marriage hunting...
\e

WinMes07:
chara_type 104
I managed to make it through this night as well...
I'm just an ordinary person...
Just how long can I keep this up?

Wha-- No way! I managed to get one over HER?! 
Were you down with the flu or something, Ciel?!

There you go, thinking you're some kind of otherwordly being.
Well if you think you're sooo much better than us humans, 
then maybe you should go fight someone who isn't.
\e

What was that? Some kind of phantom Noel...?
Come on Noel, pull yourself together...
You're still just a regular human...

Now's my chance! Retreeeaaat!
Phew... I think I managed to lose her.
That girl's abilities are no joke. Invisible attacks?
It's like those True Ancestors I've heard of...
\e

Examination complete! Guess I win! ♪
My pent-up stress is my strength.
Now you better get me that audience
with the Cardinal, 'kay?

Ahaha, no way. This is a dream, right?
I mean there's no way that I managed to
take her out after she got serious, c'mon.
I must've fallen asleep just as I got back home.

Alright! I'm winning somehow! 
I may actually be able to pull this off. No, I'm sure I can
pull this off! Now I just trap him in my temple, and then--
What?! No way! NOW he decides to get serious?!

Woo-hoo! You should take me to Vegas sometime!
