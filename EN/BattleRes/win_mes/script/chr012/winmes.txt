I do not require someone to guide me.
After all, I am quite familiar with Japanese cities.
That said, this city is far more urban than the one I know.

Dead Apostle...
Not a phrase one would hear often back in my home country.
Perhaps I should have borrowed Sir Gawain's sword
if they're so weak to sunlight.

Fate must have had a hand in this.
I could lend you my strength should it prove necessary.

There don't seem to be any other Servants here.
Hopefully I don't appear too out of place.

A nightless city that never sleeps...
Incidentally, I've heard these kinds of cities house many
late-night dining establishments that serve especially
delicious food. May I trouble you to provide me with
an address and menu recommendations?

Phew...
I'm glad I managed to finish this without causing injury.
I must be more careful not to stand out as much next time.
\e

// �Δ\�͎� Versus superpowered person (Akiha, Vlov)
// �H�t�E���A�E�����[��

Though you are my enemy, I must admit.
Your abilities are astonishing.
I may find myself defeated next time we do battle.

// �΋z���S Versus Vampire (Vlov, Roa, DA Noel, Red Arc)
// ���A�E�����[���E�\���A���N

Return to dust, monster.
I shall strike down any evil which would threaten
the populace, whatever form it may take.

// ���Ő������߁i�X�g�[���[��p�j Versus Kohaku and Hisui (when they fight together)

You two have such excellent teamwork that I mistook you
for a pair of highly skilled Assassins. Little did I suspect
you were merely a pair of mischievous maids. There's certainly
something strange about the nobility in this city.

Excellent skills.
Stay focused and let's continue sparring.

Most impressive.
I am honored to have met a player such as yourself.
