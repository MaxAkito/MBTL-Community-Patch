I do not require someone to guide me.
After all, I am quite familiar with Japanese cities.
That said, this city is far more urban than the one I know.

Dead Apostle... 
Not a word you would hear often in the land I am from.
Perhaps I should have borrowed Sir Gawain's sword if 
they're so weak to sunlight.

WinMes02:

This must be fate of some kind.
I could lend you my strength should it prove necessary.

WinMes03:

There do not seem to be any other Servants here.
Hopefully I don't appear too out of place...

A nightless city that never sleeps...
Speaking of... I have heard these sorts of inner city late 
night dining establishments serve especially delicious food.
May I ask of you to provide me with an exact address and 
recommendation as to what to order?

Phew... 
It would seem I was able to end this without injuring you. 
I've got to be careful to not stand out as much next time.

Though you are my enemy, I must admit... 
Those are some astonishing abilities you possess. 
You might come out on top next time.

Return to dust, monster.
I shall strike down any evil which would 
threaten the populace, whatever form it may take.

You two have such excellent teamwork that I mistook you for
a pair of highly skilled Assassins. To think that you were 
merely a pair of mischievous maids... There's certainly
something strange about the nobility in this city.
