Aww, dead already?
I wanted to play with you some more...
Hah! As if.
Really think I'd have time to waste on trash like you?
\e

WinMes01:
chara_type 8
chara_type_sub 7
chara_switchframe 665
Would you look at that, my injures have healed already! \sf000
Seems your efforts--even your entire life up until
this point--were all for nothing, doesn't it? Ahaha! 
You struggled so pathetically too, you poor little thing!
\e

//対人間
WinMes02:
chara_type 1
A mere human?
Standing a chance against me? 
After I'd turned into a vampire?
In your dreams.
\e

//対死徒
WinMes03:
chara_type 6
Wow, and I haven't even been a vampire all that long.
Doesn't the shame just wanna make you disappear?
Hehe... that, at least, I can arrange for you \sf000
\e

WinMes04:
chara_type 1
Ugh, boooring...
Before, any kind of battle would almost made my heart jump
out of my chest. But now, well... I guess once you get 
too strong, you need a higher class of entertainment.
\e

WinMes05:
chara_type 8
How's it feel? My Principle is the 'Bells of Nostalgia'.
Christmas bells that conjure up memories of happier times.
They are as merciless as the feeling of growing up.
\e

WinMes06:
chara_type 106
Hmph, you're not half bad. 
But I've lost my patience. I'll let you go for now. 
Don't worry, though. 
In seven days I'll exact sweet revenge upon you \sf000
\e

WinMes07:
chara_type 102
chara_type_sub 103
chara_switchframe 360
Hmph...
I'll admit, this fight taught me an important lesson.
Better note it down so I don't forget...
\e

//対シエル
WinMes08:
chara_type 2
Huh? That's odd... I mean, really. 
Being unkillable was all you were good for! 
Why you were so annoying! It was your atonement! 
So hurry up already. Wake up! 
Aren't you supposed to let me kill you some more?!
\e

//対志貴
WinMes09:
chara_type 8
Well, Shiki? 
How do you like my Mystic Eyes of Roses?
With these, I can make you experience anything 
I can think of. Anything I want \sf000
\e

//対ロア
WinMes10:
chara_type 102
I killed him...
But... now he'll just come back again...
Damn it...
What am I even doing?!
\e

// 対マーリオゥ
WinMes11:
chara_type 6
Oh no, I guess the Acting Presbyter went and died?
How awful, just reprehensible, really!
I guess God really doesn't save everyone!
\e


// 対志貴（ストーリー専用）
WinMesArcadeWin03:
chara_type 100
That's right, this whole thing is just a dream...
A nightmare of my very own creation.
You should be grateful, Shiki. 
In a way... I'm showing you mercy.
\e

// 対琥珀（ストーリー専用）
WinMesArcadeWin04:
chara_type 101
Hmm... So this is what vampire blood is made out of, huh? 
It's called "Ether", right? Being able to materalize it at
will is great and all, but isn't it kind of inconvenient 
that it's restricted to the shape of the soul?
\e

// 対ロア（ストーリー専用）
WinMesArcadeWin05:
chara_type 3
What's wrong? You sure died easily.
C'mon, why don't you go reincarnate or something?
See if I care!

WinMes3WinStreak00:
chara_type 8
Heehee. Three wins for me! 
Victory feels so gooood!
\e

WinMes10WinStreak00:
chara_type 7
Yay! I did it! Ten straight wins!
I'm totally the new heroine of this story!
\e
