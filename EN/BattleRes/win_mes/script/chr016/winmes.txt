WinMes00:
chara_type 3
Elimination complete.
Transitioning all armaments to ground state. 
Proceeding to next mission.
\e

WinMes01:
chara_type 3
Usually, I like to rely on technique and experience.
But with these armaments, force alone is enough.
At your level, you could never stop me.
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 0
You've been completely outclassed. Pathetic.
I've strengthened my physical power using magecraft. 
I have to, since I'm handling these heavy weapons 
with my feminine body.
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 1
This mallet is a horn of purity which has endured 
for millenia. You should be honored. Under normal 
circumstances, it would never be used on the likes of you.
\e

WinMes04:
chara_type 1
chara_type_sub 3
chara_switchframe 450
Blaze, Blade, Break.
These three are my current primary armaments.
Were they to your liking?
\e

WinMes05:
chara_type 203
My magical circuits are on a different level to yours.
It's like comparing the engines of a motorcycle to
those of a rocket. Did you really think you stood a chance?
\e

// 対アルクェイド
WinMes06:
chara_type 3
You underestimated MY state of excitation, Arcueid.
As such, I managed to gouge your heart out faster 
than you were able to reach your full potential power.
\e

// 対志貴 Versus Shiki
WinMes07:
chara_type 104
chara_type_sub 102
chara_switchframe 490
I know you're not a bad person, but unfortunately
you've been mixed up in this incident regardless.
I'd recommend laying low for a few nights.
You got that?
\e

// 対秋葉 Versus Akiha
WinMes08:
chara_type 103
chara_type_sub 105
chara_switchframe 600
Obviously I ought to eliminate you here and now, but...
I'll choose to believe in your humanity. Or rather, 
your self-dignity. Because in that respect, above all 
else, you're the strongest person I know, Akiha.
\e

//対暴走アルクェイド Versus Red Arcueid
WinMes09:
chara_type 1
Now that was a battle of pure power versus power.
That said, you've yet to show your true nature,
just as I've yet to deploy the entirety of the 
Seventh Scripture. We'll see which one of us 
is stronger when that time comes.
\e

//対マーリオゥ Versus Mario
WinMes10:
chara_type 203
Creatura's Piano Machine...
To think the esteemed Acting Presbyter
would be wielding such an old-fashioned weapon...
\e

//対ノエル Versus Noel
WinMes11:
chara_type 1
chara_type_sub 0
chara_switchframe 600
It appears you're at least keeping yourself at the minimum 
standard befitting of an Executor. Actually, you've even 
gotten a bit sharper lately. Did you perhaps discover some 
source of motivation to improve, Sister Noel?
\e

//対死徒ノエル Versus Dead Apostle Noel
WinMes12:
chara_type 1
Might makes right.
Dead Apostle Noel...
Your weakness... has come to judgment.
\e

// 対ロア Versus Roa
WinMes13:
chara_type 1
This is the end, Serpent of Akasha.
I've shattered your soul with the Seventh Scripture.
Your twisted beliefs have led you only to the depths of darkness.
\e

// 対吸血鬼 Versus Vampire
WinMes14:
chara_type 203
I have no sympathy or understanding to spare for inhuman 
creatures such as you. Your death will amount to no more 
than a single line of text in my report.
\e

// 対青子 Versus Aoko
WinMes15:
chara_type 201
chara_type_sub 203
chara_switchframe 130
chara_type_sub1 204
chara_switchframe1 760
So that was the Fifth Magician...
She and I are somewhat alike, yet also complete opposites.
I boast an unprecedented production of magical energy,
while she boasts an anomalous acceleration of it. 
Something like that.
\e


// 対マーリオゥ（ストーリー専用） Versus Mario (story only)
WinMesArcadeWin17:
chara_type 203
Excuse me, but I have to hurry.
I'll leave your wounds to the Executors you have with you.
That said, I'm grateful you'd go out of your way to warn me.
\e


// 99まで追加可能


// ３連勝・１０連勝専用セリフ

WinMes3WinStreak00:
chara_type 204
Three straight wins. Not that its anything special.
It's true that I'm in good condition though. 
\e

WinMes10WinStreak00:
chara_type 0
chara_type_sub 4
chara_switchframe 330
Ten whole wins... I see, ten whole wins... Hehe.
I think I'm worthy of being called a champion, don't you?
\e
