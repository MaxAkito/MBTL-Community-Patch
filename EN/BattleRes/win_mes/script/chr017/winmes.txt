Fuckin' hell, don't go losing to a goddamn kid.
And I ain't talking 'bout strength, but your noggin.
Hit the books before you challenge me again.

All I got goin' for me is my youth.
Don't need to care 'bout shame or reputation,
I can just get some adults to beat people up for me.
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 100
You'll stay a nobody for the rest 'a your life 
if all you do is depend on your own skills. 
We all got shit we can't do ourselves.
So you gotta force others to do it for you. You get me?
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 305
You can't just hope you'll fuckin' win.
I'mma part 'a the gamer generation. 
I can read your every move.

This Piano Machine was originally a silk loom.
Now it weaves people instead, controlling and 
strengthening them. My old man used to gaze longingly 
at it in the store window when he was just a boy...

Being a kid's real nice, socially speaking. 
Can pick as many fights as I want. 
Sorry, talkin' to myself here.
Don't worry 'bout it. Go take a nap, kid.

Always had a knack for violence. 
Much more useful than Theology, at least.
The times I get to use it have gone down the 
shitter ever since I became Acting Presbyter though.

We're heading back, fuckers.
You kiddin'? Need something for your place?
Goddamnit, I guess we can stop by the store. 
Keep the budget within your monthly wage, though.

Alto, contact Andou.
Took care of some trash, but I need 'im to deal with

up the scene. I want 'im investigating the victims, 
give 'em some care.

Real weird... I'd expected, well...
That you'd show off some crazy moves or somethin'...
But I guess you don't get all riled up when fighting
a human? Hah! So young, and you're already hooked on 
something so fucked up.

WinMes12:

You seem kinda whimsical, but damn you're stubborn...
(Maybe I should get 'er a bit more confident sometime.)

WinMes17:

WinMes18:
