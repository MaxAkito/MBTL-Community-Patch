Fuckin' hell, don't go losing to a goddamn kid.
And it wasn't 'cause of your strength, but your noggin.
Hit the books before you challenge me again.
\e

WinMes01:
chara_type 104
All I got goin' for me is my youth.
Don't need to care 'bout keepin' up appearances,
I can just get some adults to beat people up for me.
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 100
You'll stay a nobody for the rest of your life 
if all you do is depend on your own skills. 
We all got shit we can't do ourselves.
So you gotta force others to do it for you. You get me?
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 305
You can't just hope you'll fuckin' win.
Imma part of the gamer generation. 
I can read your every move.

This Piano Machine was originally a silk loom.
Now it weaves people instead, controlling and 
strengthening them. My old man used to gaze longingly 
at it in the store window when he was just a boy...

Being a kid's real nice, socially speaking. 
Can pick as many fights as I want. 
Sorry, was talkin' to myself there.
Don't worry 'bout it. Go take a nap, kid.
\e

WinMes06:
chara_type 100
Always had a knack for violence. 
Much more useful than theology, at least.
The times I get to use it have gone down the 
shitter ever since I became Acting Presbyter though.

We're heading back, fuckers.
You kiddin'? Need something for your place?
Goddamnit, I guess we can stop by the store. 
Keep the budget within your monthly wage, though.

// 対一般人(ヒスコハは除外した方が良さそう)
WinMes08:
chara_type 306
Soprano, contact Karius.
Tell him we've got a dumbass down. They need custody.
Make sure to get 'em some medical care as a lil extra.
\e

//対死徒（非人間）
WinMes09:
chara_type 303
Alto, contact Andou.
Took care of some trash, so I need him to deal with 
the other shit. And I ain't just talking 'bout cleaning
up the scene. I want him investigating the victims, 
give 'em some care.
\e

//対志貴
WinMes10:

chara_switchframe 680
Real weird... I'd expected, well...
That you'd show off some crazy moves or somethin'...
Guess you don't get all riled up if you're only
up against normal humans. Hah! So young, and you're 
already hooked on something so fucked up.
\e

//対アルクェイド
WinMes11:

Win's a win, but...
Feels like I'm losing my senses instead!
The hell happened to make you so different?!
\e

//対暴走アルクェイド
WinMes12:
chara_type 305
Fall back, fuckers! We're leaving.
This monster's just gonna come back stronger if we 
kill it. I ain't dumb enough to fight this head-on.
\e

// 対シエル
WinMes13:
chara_type 100
What're ya looking so confused for?
I know your lil tricks inside and out.
Planned out my countermeasures goddamn ages ago.
\e

// 対武装シエル
WinMes14:
chara_type 106
Fuckin' hell... You're real worked up.
Mezzo-Soprano, to the water chamber with her.
She'll probably cool down in three days or so.
\e

// 対ロア
WinMes15:
chara_type 306
You fucking snake bastard.
A tarantella's wasted on your ass.
A scherzo's all you'll get.
\e

// 対ノエル
WinMes16:

chara_switchframe 680
I ain't unfair enough to compare you to Ciel but...
Man, your movements are way too simple.
You seem kinda whimsical, yet also damn stubborn...
(Maybe I should whip her into shape at some point)
\e

// 対死徒ノエル
WinMes17:
chara_type 306
Soprano, Alto. Elegy permitted.
And make sure she's buried with care, will ya?
End of the day, she kept working hard for the greater good.
\e

// 対青子
WinMes18:
chara_type 305
Stop it, you piece of shit! Think you can get away
after all you did!? Mezzo-Soprano, get me Karius!
I'm 'boutta write one HELLUVA long formal 
complaint to the Mages Assocation.

Phew. Drove her back somehow.
Thank god she was so mentally unstable...
All hurdles that got me worried have now been taken 
care of. Now I just gotta wait for Roa to wake up.
\e

// 対ノエル（ストーリー専用）
WinMesArcadeWin08:
chara_type 104
Ey, good workout for the both of us.
My Piano Machine ain't in bad shape. Maybe Mario the 
Puppetmaster's gonna be back on the scene for a few years?
\e

// 対青子（ストーリー専用）
WinMesArcadeWin15:
chara_type 105
Goddamn, learn your place, Magician!
Aaah, that felt good!
Not that Laurentis didn't have this coming but... We mortals 
can be real stubborn. Ain't nothing to mess with, fucker!
