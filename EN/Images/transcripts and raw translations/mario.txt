Mario Gallo Bestino
「人形使い」の異名を持つ、聖堂教会の若き司祭代行
The young Acting Presbyter from the Church, also known as the "the Puppetmaster"

聖堂教会の司祭代行。
Acting Presbyter of the Holy Church. 
ブロンドの髪に白い肌、カジュアルな出で立ちの美少年。見た目からは想像がつかないが、
十代前半という若さで重責を担う職位に就いている。
Mario is a handsome young boy with blonde hair, fair skin and a casual appearance. You could not guess it from his looks,
but he's actually in a position of great responsiblity, despite being a youth in his early teens.

無能の者、やる気のない者が大嫌いで、しばしば辛辣な口撃を見せることもあるが、
情に厚く、義理堅い面も本質である。
He hates incompetent and unmotivated people, and will occasionally lash out with harsh words at them. 
Yet his soft-hearted and honorable side is where his true nature lies.
人の力量や素質を看破する眼力、硬軟織り交ぜた懐柔力、適材を配置し盤面を支配する統率力、
そして[ruby=ピアノマシン]『鍵盤織機』[/ruby]を用いマリオネットのようにシスターを操り戦う姿から、
『人形使い』のふたつ名を冠する。
Because of his ability to infer people's capabilities and qualities; his ability to placate people by weaving in both harshness and gentleness into his words; 
his ability to lead through making sure the right people are in the right place; but mostly, how he appears in battle as he manipulates his nuns like marionettes with his Piano Machine;
has he been granted the epiphet of "the Puppetmaster".

総耶に現れた死徒を殲滅する……のは表向きの事情。
Annihilating the Dead Apostles that have appeared in Souya... is how he explains things publically.
教会には明かさない別の目的があり、ある『研究』の情報を探っている。
He actually has another objective which he cannot reveal to the Church: to search for information about some specific 'research'.
