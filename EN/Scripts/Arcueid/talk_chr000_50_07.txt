That soul... as white as a sacred mountain...
There's no doubt about it.
We finally meet, Princess of the True Ancestors.

Who are you? I don't know of a Dead Apostle like you.
Some newbie who just popped up in these last 100 years?

We've met before, just once...
I've been following your shadow from across the distant ocean...

But neither of us can stay here for long...
This city is warm like decay, yet cold like the void.

I'll cut your head off and be awarded with your heart.
And with that, my illness shall surely heal.

I see. I wasn't really planning on it,
but if you want to die so much, I'll help you out.

Don't worry, I won't leave any traces of you behind.
It's the least I can do for such a brave brute
coming for me without any strategy!
