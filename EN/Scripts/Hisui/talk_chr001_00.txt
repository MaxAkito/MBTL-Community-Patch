Welcome. It is a pleasure to make your acquaintance. I am
Hisui, a servant under the employ of the Tohno family.

May I inquire as to the reason for your visit today?
I would be happy to pass along a message, Miss...?

I see, Miss Miyako Arima. You are the eldest daughter
of the Arima branch family, correct?

I am terribly sorry, but unfortunately Master Shiki and
Lady Akiha are both away at the moment.

Oh, I see. You wish to speak with me? So this is
an educational visit, then.
\l

Hisui
You have come to observe what it is like to live at
the Tohno estate, and to learn about my position?

(She is asking me to speak of confidential family business.
 That is information I shouldn't reveal to an outsider.)

(And yet, Miss Miyako has a determined look in her eyes.
 That is not something I can easily ignore.)

*Ahem* Very well. It is always good to see someone
who is willing to work hard and learn new skills.

I don't know how helpful I will be, but I shall assist
you in any way I can.
