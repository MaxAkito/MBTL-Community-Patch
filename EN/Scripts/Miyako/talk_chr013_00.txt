I'll get straight to the point,
I have an older brother.

To be more specific, I gained an older brother seven years
ago. And although I'm a fully-fledged adult now...
\l

/*-auto-*/\\@VOICE_PLAY@<0, "13Miy/Miy05_0002", 100>
Miyako
Back then, I was still a child. I didn't really understand
the whole story behind his sudden arrival.
