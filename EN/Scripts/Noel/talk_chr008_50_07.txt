 How much bad luck can one person have?!)

(Something seems off about him, though. Is he...sad?
 He sure doesn't feel as threatening as a Dead Apostle.)

I have plenty of heat... For the moment,
I am content.

I would prefer to remain here in peace, staring into

I suggest you leave before my generosity
runs out, Executor.

As if you had such a thing! You and your kind have never
once shown an inkling of generosity.

I'm not exactly thrilled at the prospect of fighting
a monster like you by myself.

By killing you, I'll be able to prove myself to him!
Then maybe I'll get the happy ending I deserve!
