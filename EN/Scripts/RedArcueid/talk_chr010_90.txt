Hm...? I feel like someone has been whispering terrifying

How did I get way up here?! I'm not a fan of heights!

After I went through all that trouble to recover your body

I don't think you understand the position you're in.
Perhaps I should just squeeze the life out of you right now.

Hey! Stop swinging me around, idiot!
Oh god, I'm going to fall!

I'll say it again, and as many times as it takes...

Shiki
Aren't you embarrassed at all about being a giant?! Snapping
and going on a rampage like that?! It's disgraceful!

/*-auto-*/\\@VOICE_PLAY@<0, "10Boa/Boa06_0006", 100>
Red_Arcueid
And just why should I feel embarrassed?
\l

/*-auto-*/\\@VOICE_PLAY@<0, "10Boa/Boa06_0007", 100>
Red_Arcueid
Why should the words of someone clinging onto a person's
thumb for dear life affect me in any way whatsoever?

/*-auto-*/\\@VOICE_PLAY@<0, "03Sik/Sik06_0015", 100>
Shiki
Sure it hasn't affected you? I'd say you've regained at
least some of your senses. You just called yourself a person.


/*-auto-*/\\@VOICE_PLAY@<0, "10Boa/Boa06_0008", 100>
Red_Arcueid
That's it, I'm killing you now. I was thinking of forgiving you
for killing me if you paid me back, but I've changed my mind.

Since you seem to want it so badly, I'll end it all now.

Gaaahhhhhh!!!
Are you saying this was all my fault?!
