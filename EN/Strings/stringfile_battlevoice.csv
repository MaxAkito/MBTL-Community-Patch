battlevoice_chr000_100,I hope this proves at least something of a fight.,
battlevoice_chr000_101,I don't wanna look at you.,

battlevoice_chr000_650,"You've got guts, I'll give you that.",
battlevoice_chr000_651,"Alright, how about we play around for real?",
battlevoice_chr000_652,Maybe I should be a little serious?,
battlevoice_chr000_653,"You're gonna fight me with that equipment? Looking down on me?",
battlevoice_chr000_630,Really think this is even gonna be a fight?,
battlevoice_chr000_631,"Yet again, your body lacks class.",
battlevoice_chr000_632,You've become to ingrained into this land,

battlevoice_chr000_620,Oh? Are you feeling bad?,
battlevoice_chr000_660,Get up already. I'm sick of waiting.,
battlevoice_chr000_661,"Just a little more, I think.",
battlevoice_chr000_662,"Too slow. You did gain weight, didn't you?",
battlevoice_chr000_635,Playing dead? It suits you.,
battlevoice_chr000_636,You still wanna keep up your pathetic struggle?,
battlevoice_chr000_638,"Oh, you're still alive? Well then.",

battlevoice_chr000_624,Sorry! I was really feeling it!,
battlevoice_chr000_665,"Wait, we're already done?",
battlevoice_chr000_666,Are you on a diet or something?,
battlevoice_chr000_668,"That was so fun! Nicely done, Ciel!",
battlevoice_chr000_669,How frail... Wait, you must be an imposter then!,
battlevoice_chr000_640,You're nothing more than a snake.,

battlevoice_chr001_102,You ought to return home at once.,
battlevoice_chr001_103,I shall begin cleaning.,
battlevoice_chr001_104,If you wish to have something to eat perhaps I could offer you this plum sandwich.,
battlevoice_chr001_105,"Master Shiki, it is past your bedtime.",
battlevoice_chr001_106,"K-Kohaku, h-here I come!",
battlevoice_chr001_107,"I have a tight schedule, please make it brief",
battlevoice_chr001_108,Quite the unusual event this is.,
battlevoice_chr001_811,"You asked for me, Lady Akiha?",
battlevoice_chr001_812,An evaluation for a possible raise? Understood.,
battlevoice_chr001_813,"Of course, allow me to display my cleaning techniques.",

battlevoice_chr001_814,Leave the security to me.,
battlevoice_chr001_815,Wait... Kohaku... did you...?,
battlevoice_chr001_130,You will all be the culprit.,
battlevoice_chr001_131,Did I win...?,
battlevoice_chr001_132,Humiliation in crushing defeat.,
battlevoice_chr001_133,"I-I'm terribly sorry!",
battlevoice_chr001_806,"I-I'm terribly sorry!",
battlevoice_chr001_134,I-I managed to win somehow...,
battlevoice_chr001_135,I understand you must not have been feeling well.,
battlevoice_chr001_804,This too is part of a servant's job.,
battlevoice_chr001_805,I am pleased that it appears you enjoyed yourself.,
battlevoice_chr001_816,Was that enough to earn your approval?,
battlevoice_chr001_817,I still have much to learn. I must do better.,
battlevoice_chr001_818,"A flawless performance, if I may say so myself.",
battlevoice_chr001_150,It appears time is up.,
battlevoice_chr001_151,Splendidly done.,
battlevoice_chr002_100,Are you ready?,
battlevoice_chr002_101,"Honestly, why must I do this?",
battlevoice_chr002_102,I am not lenient, so you know.,
battlevoice_chr002_103,"Shall we begin, then?",
battlevoice_chr002_104,"Quite fearless, aren't you?",
battlevoice_chr002_105,.....,
battlevoice_chr002_106,I hope you're prepared for the consequences.,
battlevoice_chr002_107,"Let's keep this brief, shall we?",
battlevoice_chr002_630,"No, that's not what this is about... *sigh*",
battlevoice_chr002_631,"Very well, I, the family head, shall accept your challenge.",
battlevoice_chr002_110,You are quite skilled.,
battlevoice_chr002_111,"No more holding back, then.",
battlevoice_chr002_112,No more mercy.,
battlevoice_chr002_120,Are you injured?,
battlevoice_chr002_121,Was that to your liking?,
battlevoice_chr002_122,Hehe. That got a bit exciting.,
battlevoice_chr002_123,"Oh dear, is that all?",
battlevoice_chr002_620,That's one for me.,
battlevoice_chr002_621,I-I don't think you should be all too hurt...,
battlevoice_chr002_622,I do dabble in this now and then.,
battlevoice_chr002_623,"Please, you're so undisciplined.",
battlevoice_chr002_632,"Still unhurt? Good... then let's keep going",
battlevoice_chr002_633,You're not so bad after all.,
battlevoice_chr002_634,"Oh dear, is that all?",
battlevoice_chr002_130,"Right, I believe I can let you off now.",
battlevoice_chr002_635,"Right, I believe I can let you off now.",
battlevoice_chr002_131,Are you injured?,
battlevoice_chr002_132,Surely you've learned your lesson?,
battlevoice_chr002_637,Surely you've learned your lesson?,
battlevoice_chr002_133,How absurd. You'll have to do better.,
battlevoice_chr002_638,How absurd. You'll have to do better.,
battlevoice_chr002_134,"Hehe, this has been a great way to relieve stress.",
battlevoice_chr002_135,That was about what I expected.,
battlevoice_chr002_624,"We've just gotten started, better start feeling sorry",
battlevoice_chr002_625,Have you been convinced?,
battlevoice_chr002_626,"Well, I will give you that you did your best.",
battlevoice_chr002_627,Wha- my brother is so weak...,
battlevoice_chr002_636,I wonder if I went too far...,
battlevoice_chr002_150,I cannot accept that!,
battlevoice_chr002_151,Why you impudent little...!,
battlevoice_chr002_108,Shouldn't you be working?,
battlevoice_chr003_100,You're serious about this.,
battlevoice_chr003_101,"I'd rather not, but it would seem I have no choice.",
battlevoice_chr003_102,Let's keep this short. I don't have much stamina.,
battlevoice_chr003_103,My head aches so...,
battlevoice_chr003_104,You're making your brother worried.,
battlevoice_chr003_105,I'm against domestic violence!,
battlevoice_chr003_106,"A light spar, is it?",
battlevoice_chr003_107,"Aren't you saying you just wanna play around?!",
battlevoice_chr003_108,"Isn't that an abuse of power, Ciel?",
battlevoice_chr003_109,You're telling me the whole Sister thing wasn't just a hobby!?,
battlevoice_chr003_113,"Can we take this elsewher- Not gonna listen, huh?",
battlevoice_chr003_114,Looks like we're both outta luck.,
battlevoice_chr003_650,Um... why did it come to this?,
battlevoice_chr003_110,This is only the beginning.,
battlevoice_chr003_111,"Okay, I've got the gist of it.",
battlevoice_chr003_112,This is getting a little out of hand.,
battlevoice_chr003_652,Damn... So tired...,
battlevoice_chr003_121,Good grief, this is rough.,
battlevoice_chr003_122,"This isn't over yet, is it?",
battlevoice_chr003_123,"You're better than this, aren't you?",
battlevoice_chr003_124,What a nightmare...,
battlevoice_chr003_120,Damn... So tired...,
battlevoice_chr003_653,There's no blunt edge on my knife.,
battlevoice_chr003_654,"This isn't over yet, is it?!",
battlevoice_chr003_655,"You're still just raring to go, aren't you?",
battlevoice_chr003_130,"Phew, thought I was a goner there for a minute.",
battlevoice_chr003_131,All's well that ends well.,
battlevoice_chr003_657,"Alright, let's leave it at that then".,
battlevoice_chr003_132,I'm legging it! As if I'd stay around for this!,
battlevoice_chr003_658,"Sorry, I've gotta return some video-tapes!",
battlevoice_chr003_133,"If you've had enough, then give up already.",
battlevoice_chr003_134,"This is the end. Begone, vampire.",
battlevoice_chr003_135,"No matter how many times I live, it won't be enough for this.",
battlevoice_chr003_136,"Don't force yourself, just stay down.",
battlevoice_chr003_656,I guess you've settled down?,
battlevoice_chr003_659,Whoops. Looks like I win.,
battlevoice_chr003_150,Damn... That hurt!,
battlevoice_chr003_151,Were you trying to stall for time...?,
battlevoice_chr004_100,Hehehe. Let's get going!,
battlevoice_chr004_101,The dependable maid makes her appearance!,
battlevoice_chr004_102,What kind of medicine do you prefer?,
battlevoice_chr004_103,Tonight's injection will be a little different!,
battlevoice_chr004_105,"Hehehe. You weren't supposed to see that, Shiki.",
battlevoice_chr004_106,Hehehe! Let's have a fair fight!,
battlevoice_chr004_107,You look rather suspicious! Your judgment has come!,
battlevoice_chr004_780,"Ah, a snap inspection is it, Lady Akiha?",
battlevoice_chr004_781,I do this to preserve the peace for the Tohno household.,
battlevoice_chr004_782,Have my actions yesterday been discover--?,
battlevoice_chr004_783,I'm afraid Shiki is not here.,
battlevoice_chr004_110,This is an outrage!,
battlevoice_chr004_111,Looks like I've been backed into a corner.,
battlevoice_chr004_112,Must think positive!,
battlevoice_chr004_120,"'kay, cleaning complete!".,
battlevoice_chr004_121,Don't you change that channel! ÅÙ,
battlevoice_chr004_122,Was that to your satisfaction?,
battlevoice_chr004_123,I know how to handle a broom.,
battlevoice_chr004_790,"I am your physician after all, Shiki.",
battlevoice_chr004_791,"Let's not tell Lady Akiha about this, all right?",
battlevoice_chr004_784,What's that? Even the mighty Akiha can stumble?,
battlevoice_chr004_785,It would seem both of us have revealed our intentions.,
battlevoice_chr004_789,Have you fallen for me all over again?,
battlevoice_chr004_131,What an unexpected outcome! ÅÙ,
battlevoice_chr004_132,"Phew, that was close.",
battlevoice_chr004_776,"Phew, that was close.",
battlevoice_chr004_133,I did it! An overwhelming victory! ÅÙ,
battlevoice_chr004_134,Please be sure to make an appointment next time.,
battlevoice_chr004_135,"No more pranks, 'kay?.",
battlevoice_chr004_792,I appears my survelliance is still lacking...,
battlevoice_chr004_793,Hehehe! Right in the palm of my hand!,
battlevoice_chr004_130,Have you fallen for me all over again?,
battlevoice_chr004_786,Heh-heh-heh! The social structure has been overturned!,
battlevoice_chr004_787,I thought I felt real bloodlust there a few times.,
battlevoice_chr004_788,I must have just gotten lucky this time.,
battlevoice_chr004_150,Does that count as forfeiting?,
battlevoice_chr004_151,But I was the more attractive heroine!,
battlevoice_chr005_100,What a waste of your singular life.,
battlevoice_chr005_101,What's this? Are you in need of an early death?,
battlevoice_chr005_102,Very well. I'll make it brief.,
battlevoice_chr005_103,Hm... Looks like this body has its limits.,
battlevoice_chr005_104,I'm a bit tired of all the killing I do...,
battlevoice_chr005_109,"If it's just the skin, then take as much as you'd like.",
battlevoice_chr005_105,How wonderful... My seventeenth matrimony!,
battlevoice_chr005_106,"Well now, If only that were true.",
battlevoice_chr005_107,So fresh. I must be lucky tonight.,
battlevoice_chr005_108,"Damn, it's good to be alive.",
battlevoice_chr005_630,"The vessel is reaching its breaking point? Then my hundreds of years of love shall fade.",
battlevoice_chr005_110,Don't die on me too easily.,
battlevoice_chr005_111,It seems that I have underestimated you...,
battlevoice_chr005_112,Not bad. This might be fun after all.,
battlevoice_chr005_120,A body that can move like this ain't half bad!,
battlevoice_chr005_121,"Hah! Give me a little more entertainment, will you?",
battlevoice_chr005_122,I see. So this is all you're capable of.,
battlevoice_chr005_123,Looks like we're both getting warmed up.,
battlevoice_chr005_635,"C'mon, what's the matter? You seem a bit slow.",
battlevoice_chr005_636,This is what happens when you have nothing but strength.,
battlevoice_chr005_637,"Give a break, did you get hit a meteor or something?!",
battlevoice_chr005_638,What a great sensation. I could get used to this.,
battlevoice_chr005_130,"You're still in one piece, aren't you? Get up.",
battlevoice_chr005_131,Hmph. May you slumber in hell eternal.,
battlevoice_chr005_132,It would seem you've underestimated me.,
battlevoice_chr005_133,Hurry up and die, you shit! You're wasting everyone's time!,
battlevoice_chr005_134,"A good fight deserves a good meal, isn't that normal?",
battlevoice_chr005_135,"Well then, my expectations were not met.",
battlevoice_chr005_645,Seriously?! Funniest shit ever!,
battlevoice_chr005_646,Looks like the vessel has reached its breaking point.,
battlevoice_chr005_647,Thank you for the exquisite disappointment.,
battlevoice_chr005_648,What's even happening?! Am I in all-time form or what?!,
battlevoice_chr005_150,Great. Another undecided outcome.,
battlevoice_chr005_151,This is why I hate having a time limit!,
battlevoice_chr006_100,You will be crushed.,
battlevoice_chr006_101,Allow me to perform your rites.,
battlevoice_chr006_102,The saha world can be so turbulent.,
battlevoice_chr006_103,Would be great if we could just end this with a laugh.,
battlevoice_chr006_104,"I shall fight you, though your desires won't be granted".,
battlevoice_chr006_105,You simply live as you please. Most enviable.,
battlevoice_chr006_110,Hyaaahhh!,
battlevoice_chr006_111,That was a pitiful display.,
battlevoice_chr006_112,"Now then, what shall we do?",
battlevoice_chr006_120,Next.,
battlevoice_chr006_121,Keep it in moderation.,
battlevoice_chr006_122,You still rise? What an ordeal.,
battlevoice_chr006_123,"Such fighting spirit, practically overflowing.",
battlevoice_chr006_130,You are bereft of grace.,
battlevoice_chr006_131,Do you wish to continue?,
battlevoice_chr006_132,"This has proven a good lesson, my thanks.",
battlevoice_chr006_133,Unsatisfying...,
battlevoice_chr006_135,I must thank you for the workout.,
battlevoice_chr006_136,It's over. Speak your last while you still draw breath.,
battlevoice_chr006_137,I've been made the fool!,
battlevoice_chr006_150,Now the sila cannot be adhered to...,
battlevoice_chr006_151,How far I have fallen...,
battlevoice_chr008_100,Alrighty! Time to get to work!,
battlevoice_chr008_101,Executor Noel makes her grand entrance!,
battlevoice_chr008_102,Oh, I think it's time for repentance.,
battlevoice_chr008_103,Don't expect me to go easy on you. 'kay?,
battlevoice_chr008_104,"Oh no, my teaching job is the hobby \sf000",
battlevoice_chr008_105,I appreciate the lesson!\sf000,
battlevoice_chr008_106,Eeek! As if the True Ancestor wasn't scary enough before!,
battlevoice_chr008_107,OK! Time to fight!,
battlevoice_chr008_108,And just what are you staring at, you cheeky little thing Åô,
battlevoice_chr008_110,I'll add your grudge to the list.,
battlevoice_chr008_111,I'm going to snap that little neck of yours.\sf000,
battlevoice_chr008_112,"Oh, come on!",
battlevoice_chr008_120,Wha-? You're still alive? Gross!,
battlevoice_chr008_121,Were you maybe considering something... taboo?,
battlevoice_chr008_122,Silly me, I might have gone a bit overboard \sf000,
battlevoice_chr008_123,"You're such a softie, that's so cute.",
battlevoice_chr008_124,What's the matter? Out of shape?,
battlevoice_chr008_665,Just how I imagined it!,
battlevoice_chr008_666,"You weren't thinking about Shiki just now, were you?",
battlevoice_chr008_667,"A stronger punch would-- No, nothing!",
battlevoice_chr008_668,At least it's gone well this far...,
battlevoice_chr008_130,"Ok! Inquisitioning complete.",
battlevoice_chr008_131,Just kidding! Did I give you a scare?,
battlevoice_chr008_132,That was real close! What a thankless job!,
battlevoice_chr008_133,"I'm sorry, it's just that I'm real strong against weaklings.",
battlevoice_chr008_135,Sorry about that. Was I too intimidating?,
battlevoice_chr008_134,Did you enjoy my special lesson?,
battlevoice_chr008_136,Easy-peasy! Awesome! Åô,
battlevoice_chr008_670,"Oh, I get it! This Ciel is a fake!",
battlevoice_chr008_671,What's happening? this went so well I'm getting scared.,
battlevoice_chr008_673,"Wow, no way! I won?! Yaaay!",
battlevoice_chr008_675,"Please, could you not hold back so obviously against me?",
battlevoice_chr008_150,Even time is against me!,
battlevoice_chr008_151,God I hate working overtime!,
battlevoice_chr009_100,You will make nice kindling for my pyre.,
battlevoice_chr009_101,Who... are you...?,
battlevoice_chr009_102,Don't resist. You're wasting your warmth.,
battlevoice_chr009_103,No need for introductions...,
battlevoice_chr009_104,Hand over your heart...,
battlevoice_chr009_105,I shall kill you by flaying your skin...,
battlevoice_chr009_106,"A pupil of the Swordmonk? Where's the Dragon-bone Blade?",
battlevoice_chr009_107,This blood-bag will at least serve well as a bonfire.,
battlevoice_chr009_108,"You will fail to make it out alive.",
battlevoice_chr009_110,A wound? Wonderful.,
battlevoice_chr009_111,"Try not to make my heart flutter, will you?",
battlevoice_chr009_112,Perhaps I should take this seriously.,
battlevoice_chr009_120,You are overflowing with vitality.,
battlevoice_chr009_121,More. Give me more heat...,
battlevoice_chr009_122,I missed. I grow duller by the day.,
battlevoice_chr009_123,"*haah, haah*",
battlevoice_chr009_130,Now this a hunt.,
battlevoice_chr009_131,"So it's over then, you fought well.",
battlevoice_chr009_132,"I do not feel pain, I only grow cold.",
battlevoice_chr009_133,It would seem I got a bit heated for a moment.,
battlevoice_chr009_134,"This is not even funny, what were you doing?",
battlevoice_chr009_135,A thrilling hunt. You will make for nice kindling.,
battlevoice_chr009_150,The sun has already risen?,
battlevoice_chr009_151,This is unacceptable...,
battlevoice_chr010_100,Humans really are pathetic little things.,
battlevoice_chr010_101,"Will you shame yourself for my enjoyment, I wonder?",
battlevoice_chr010_102,"If don't hurry up and stop me, you'll have a lot of trouble on your hands",
battlevoice_chr010_103,"Be patient, I'll kill you soon enough.",
battlevoice_chr010_104,"Good evening, my lovely little murderer.",
battlevoice_chr010_105,"What a delightful body you have, let me mess it up for you!".,
battlevoice_chr010_106,"That's my line, King of Swords. How about you scurry back to Avalon?",
battlevoice_chr010_107,"How do you put up with this one, Ciel?",
battlevoice_chr010_108,Hehe. Do you want to play for a bit?,
battlevoice_chr010_109,Hm... I have no use for this.,
battlevoice_chr010_660,The biggest nuisances always show up at the worst times.,
battlevoice_chr010_661,"I nearly forgot about you, snake. Come to get crushed under my shoe again?",
battlevoice_chr010_110,"Well, well... I didn't expect you to do that.",
battlevoice_chr010_111,Ready to go again?,
battlevoice_chr010_112,It's not enough to cut you into pieces.,
battlevoice_chr010_113,"For a lower being, you're actually pretty tough.",
battlevoice_chr010_114,You're more interesting than you look.,
battlevoice_chr010_115,Maybe I'll wipe out this whole town along with you.,
battlevoice_chr010_120,"Kneel, cur.",
battlevoice_chr010_662,"Kneel, cur.",
battlevoice_chr010_121,What a meager voice. Doesn't give me much to be exicted about.,
battlevoice_chr010_663,What a meager voice. Doesn't give me much to be exicted about.,
battlevoice_chr010_664,Well? Feel like dying yet?,
battlevoice_chr010_122,Come on! You'll have to do better than that! If not, you'll die!,
battlevoice_chr010_123,"So, do you realize what you're up against yet?",
battlevoice_chr010_652,"So, do you realize what you're up against yet?",
battlevoice_chr010_124,"I'm this close to getting my revenge. Where will you run to next, Shiki?",
battlevoice_chr010_640,"I need to hold back a bit, this is worth savoring some more.",
battlevoice_chr010_650,"You have a body worth defacing, I love it.",
battlevoice_chr010_651,You got off already? How about another round?,
battlevoice_chr010_130,That's it, huh? Guess I shouldn't be surprised.,
battlevoice_chr010_653,That's it, huh? Guess I shouldn't be surprised.,
battlevoice_chr010_666,That's it, huh? Guess I shouldn't be surprised.,
battlevoice_chr010_131,That wasn't even enough to pass the time.,
battlevoice_chr010_667,That wasn't even enough to pass the time.,
battlevoice_chr010_668,I don't believe this. What am I doing?,
battlevoice_chr010_132,I feel so sluggish. Guess I shouldn't have acted so coy before.,
battlevoice_chr010_133,Heheh... heheheh.... Hahahahaha!,
battlevoice_chr010_669,Heheh... heheheh.... Hahahahaha!,
battlevoice_chr010_134,Ahh, this is so good! The way you break so easily! I can't get enough!,
battlevoice_chr010_135,Huh? You're finished already? But I didn't even get off myself...,
battlevoice_chr010_641,"Oh, that's it? That wasn't any fun at all...",
battlevoice_chr010_642,Did you think you'd be Event Stored? You'll have to suffer like this for the rest of your life!,
battlevoice_chr010_643,A real shame. If you'd been a bit more clever, you might have been able to kill me.,
battlevoice_chr010_644,Aren't you a bit too weak?! That dumb reptile would put up more of a fight!,
battlevoice_chr010_654,"Well, I suppose that killed a little time.",
battlevoice_chr010_655,You just keep prickling me. How annoying can one person be?,
battlevoice_chr010_656,I'm disappointed. You're even more broken than I am.,
battlevoice_chr010_150,Damn... You're better than I thought...,
battlevoice_chr010_151,Why do I have to follow some stupid rule?!,
battlevoice_chr011_100,Are you finished repenting?,
battlevoice_chr011_101,Shall we have a little after-meal workout?,
battlevoice_chr011_102,I'm sending your soul to purgatory.,
battlevoice_chr011_103,"Let's see, how should I take care of this?",
battlevoice_chr011_104,"But first, I'll splatter that crazed brain of yours onto the pavement.",
battlevoice_chr011_105,"Unfortunately, the Seventh Holy Scripture is a very costly weapon.",
battlevoice_chr011_106,I don't approve of late-night loitering! I hope you'll agree to be taken in!,
battlevoice_chr011_107,"Your reincarnations meet their end, Serpent of Akasha.",
battlevoice_chr011_109,"Let's see, what would be the best way to clean up this mess?",
battlevoice_chr011_113,Time to receive judgment.,
battlevoice_chr011_114,Shall we have a little pre-meal workout?,
battlevoice_chr011_780,"So you've lost your sani-- No... I guess you never had any to begin with.",
battlevoice_chr011_781,"I am an Executor, it is my duty to eliminate vampires.",
battlevoice_chr011_750,"Good Lord...",
battlevoice_chr011_751,Are you keeping up with your duties?,
battlevoice_chr011_752,Catch your breath before you try to speak.,
battlevoice_chr011_110,My eyes have been opened.,
battlevoice_chr011_111,You are better than I had anticipated.,
battlevoice_chr011_112,"No more fooling around, then.",
battlevoice_chr011_120,"If you want to run, now's the chance.",
battlevoice_chr011_121,"Well, I guess that's that.",
battlevoice_chr011_122,Do you wish to continue?,
battlevoice_chr011_123,"*yawn*! Oh, my apologies.",
battlevoice_chr011_782,I'll be sure not to let up.,
battlevoice_chr011_783,I refuse to show you any openings.,
battlevoice_chr011_784,"Remaining armaments, confirmed. Moving in for the kill.",
battlevoice_chr011_770,Very well. Perhaps I can play a while longer.,
battlevoice_chr011_771,"Hehe. You are my junior, after all.",
battlevoice_chr011_772,Looks like you're more than just your Mystic Eyes.,
battlevoice_chr011_773,Sorry. I was so captivated that I forgot to hold back.,
battlevoice_chr011_753,Please stop pretending to that your down already.,
battlevoice_chr011_754,"You'll never stop being so lazy, will you?",
battlevoice_chr011_755,The real battle starts here.,
battlevoice_chr011_756,Disgusting. I will show you no sympathy.,
battlevoice_chr011_757,Allow me to show you how an Executor fights.,
battlevoice_chr011_130,You can make up for your sins by living your life right.,
battlevoice_chr011_131,Just kidding! I was just scaring you a bit there.,
battlevoice_chr011_132,"You really made me work for this, didn't you?",
battlevoice_chr011_133,"You just had to interrupt me right before dinner, didn't you?",
battlevoice_chr011_135,Just kidding! I was just scaring you a bit there.,
battlevoice_chr011_775,Just kidding! I was just scaring you a bit there.,
battlevoice_chr011_136,"All right, guess I'll leave the aftermath to the Acting Presbyter.",
battlevoice_chr011_137,"Okay, we're done here! Be more careful next time!",
battlevoice_chr011_785,I'll make up for your sins by taking your life.,
battlevoice_chr011_786,"Phew, I managed to somehow take her out.",
battlevoice_chr011_787,Hm? That was a bit milder to the taste than I imagined.,
battlevoice_chr011_774,Let's head straight for the tea-ceremony clubroom!,
battlevoice_chr011_762,"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. The time for reckoning has come.",
battlevoice_chr011_776,"Phew, that was close.",
battlevoice_chr011_777,You were basically completely helpless. How pathetic.,
battlevoice_chr011_758,That's enough. Good work today.,
battlevoice_chr011_759,I expect a full report by tomorrow.,
battlevoice_chr011_760,"You were quite decisive, it seems you've grown."
battlevoice_chr011_761,Perhaps you should explore your strong points sometime?,
battlevoice_chr011_150,Out of time... Don't blame this on laziness.,
battlevoice_chr011_151,There won't be a next time!,
battlevoice_chr012_100,Let us begin.,
battlevoice_chr012_101,There is no need to hold back.,
battlevoice_chr012_102,You should fight me with everything you have.,
battlevoice_chr012_103,The restaurant should be around here... What?!,
battlevoice_chr012_104,A plum sandwich? It sort of reminds me of home.,
battlevoice_chr012_105,A high-purity elemental?! I didn't expect to find any of those remaining!,
battlevoice_chr012_106,I accept your challenge.,
battlevoice_chr012_107,I would prefer to remain inconspicuous.,
battlevoice_chr012_110,The real battle begins now.,
battlevoice_chr012_111,Let us continue this.,
battlevoice_chr012_112,Retreat was never an option.,
battlevoice_chr012_120,Show me what you can do.,
battlevoice_chr012_121,Stand up. Our fight is only beginning.,
battlevoice_chr012_122,I'm not doing too badly.,
battlevoice_chr012_123,Feel free to use your full strength.,
battlevoice_chr012_130,That was a good fight.,
battlevoice_chr012_131,I will uphold my vows as a knight.,
battlevoice_chr012_132,That wasn't exactly the kind of battle I'm used to.,
battlevoice_chr012_133,That was a satisfying match.,
battlevoice_chr012_135,That was a good fight.,
battlevoice_chr012_136,You still have much to learn.,
battlevoice_chr012_137,An excellent show of skill.,
battlevoice_chr012_150,I misjudged that fight.,
battlevoice_chr012_151,A time limit?! That's a thing?!,
battlevoice_chr013_100,"All right, let's do this!",
battlevoice_chr013_101,I'll show you how much my Kung Fu has improved!,

battlevoice_chr004_704,"Wow, looks pretty tough...!",
battlevoice_chr001_704,"Kohaku, be serious, please.",
battlevoice_chr000_680,But of course. I'm keeping myself at your level.,
battlevoice_chr000_681,"What? You can't do that, can you?!",
battlevoice_chr000_682,"I could ask the newest Magician the same thing.",
battlevoice_chr003_670,Of course not. I've got nothing to be afraid of.,
battlevoice_chr003_671,I see... You're past saving.,
battlevoice_chr003_672,Sheesh. That's just like you.,
battlevoice_chr003_673,Right... this is the kinda person she was...,
battlevoice_chr003_674,"Wait are you serious, you're gonna see how I've been by fighting me?!",
battlevoice_chr003_680,"Yeah... right in the jaw, too...",
battlevoice_chr003_681,"You're a real drill sergeant, you know...?",
battlevoice_chr003_682,It's fine... That won't be necessary.,
battlevoice_chr005_650,"Don't be like that, my fellow vampire. I promise, this'll be electrifying.",
battlevoice_chr005_651,What's wrong? I don't think you wanna murder me enough, young lady!,
battlevoice_chr005_652,"That was a long time ago. As you can see, I'm more of an outlaw now!",
battlevoice_chr008_690,"That's Roa's current form...?",
battlevoice_chr010_680,"What an annoying little crane fly. Wait, I see. You want to be squashed.",
battlevoice_chr010_681,"You look happy. Perfect, all the better when I make you grovel.",
battlevoice_chr010_682,An unpleasant lapdog of the order... I'll get rid of you here and now.,
battlevoice_chr011_790,I hope that's indeed the case.,
battlevoice_chr011_791,(Heehee... We match... since we both wear glasses!),
battlevoice_chr011_792,"Ha-ha-ha. No idea who you might be, but I'll be taking you down, okay?",
battlevoice_chr014_100,"It's time for the hunt, little rabbit.",
battlevoice_chr014_101,"Don't worry, I promise this will be fun...for me.",
battlevoice_chr014_102,I'm bored of this reality.Åô Time for a reset!\sf000,
battlevoice_chr014_103,I wonder what kind of noise you'll make?,
battlevoice_chr014_104,You think this is going to be a challenge?,

battlevoice_chr014_110,Humans are just sooo pathetic!\sf000,
battlevoice_chr014_111,"Not running from me, huh? What a bad boy\sf000",
battlevoice_chr014_112,What's this? I think I might be able to handle you after all,
battlevoice_chr014_113,What IS that thing?! Nobody told me about this!,
battlevoice_chr014_114,And you are...? Please, come back to me in Ciel's body instead.,
battlevoice_chr014_115,"Right, now that you've been found by me you're past saving, Shiki!",
battlevoice_chr014_125,This is sooo wonderful!,
battlevoice_chr014_126,"Whoopsie, I broke another of my toys!\sf000",
battlevoice_chr014_127,"Oh, you're still alive? Sweet!",
battlevoice_chr014_128,I'm at the top of my game!,
battlevoice_chr014_130,Ugh. I hate it when they finish prematurely.,
battlevoice_chr014_131,See you in your dreams.,
battlevoice_chr014_132,Giving up already? Pathetic!,
battlevoice_chr014_133,"Another flawless victory!ÅÙ I am a vampire, after all.Åô",
battlevoice_chr014_134,"You think way too much of yourself, you weakling.",
battlevoice_chr014_135,That was way too easy! I'm taking you home with me!,
battlevoice_chr014_116,Haha... Ahahaha! Yay! Now I'm stronger than you! ,
battlevoice_chr014_117,Just look at what you've done! They're all dead. ,
battlevoice_chr014_118,Liar. I know that's not how you really feel.,
battlevoice_chr014_630,Is it finally starting to sink in?,
battlevoice_chr014_631,Hahaha! You look pathetic.,
battlevoice_chr014_632,"Get up. You're stronger than this, aren't you?",
battlevoice_chr014_633,What are you scheming...?,
battlevoice_chr014_640,Ahahaha! Serves you right!,
battlevoice_chr014_641,Seriously? You can't move anymore?,
battlevoice_chr014_642,I did it...! This is what I'm truly capable of...!,
battlevoice_chr014_643,"Your attacks are weak. You're not going soft on me, are you?",
battlevoice_chr015_100,"You want to fight? Of course, I'd be glad to.",
battlevoice_chr015_101,Things are starting to get exciting.,
battlevoice_chr015_102,"Don't go too hard on me, okay?",
battlevoice_chr015_103,I won't hold anything back. Is that all right with you?,
battlevoice_chr015_104,Challenge accepted!,
battlevoice_chr015_105,Shall we have a little after-meal workout?,
battlevoice_chr015_110,"Should the esteemed Princess really be wandering around out here?",
battlevoice_chr015_111,Feel free to cut lose, I'll bring my max in kind!,
battlevoice_chr015_112,Let's have ourselves a quick match!,
battlevoice_chr015_113,Wild MENTOR has appeared!,
battlevoice_chr015_114,"'course, seeing is believing, after all.",
battlevoice_chr015_115,Get over here. I'll take you on.,
battlevoice_chr015_116,Weren't you more of a theologian rather than a Dead Apostle?,
battlevoice_chr015_117,"Hey, I know that store! Let's go there when we're done.",
battlevoice_chr015_118,You're Shiki's sister? Really...?,
battlevoice_chr015_119,This girl... Doesn't she look a little like me?,
battlevoice_chr015_120,"(Oh, seems Shiki's told her about me!)",
battlevoice_chr015_121,"I'll have to politelly decline. It's not easy coming back, you know?",
battlevoice_chr015_135,That's a win for me!,
battlevoice_chr015_136,"Come on, you're better than this, aren't you?",
battlevoice_chr015_137,Just how I imagined it!,
battlevoice_chr015_138,"No holding back, okay?",
battlevoice_chr015_140,"Oh, I'm sorry! Did my kick actually hit you?",
battlevoice_chr015_141,Focus. Let's go again.,
battlevoice_chr015_145,You've still got a ways to go.,
battlevoice_chr015_146,I hope you learned something from this.,
battlevoice_chr015_147,Maybe we'll meet again someday.,
battlevoice_chr015_148,"Whoops, did I knock you out already?",
battlevoice_chr015_149,That was fun. Want to go again?,
battlevoice_chr015_150,That was a decent warm up. Sorry if I was too hard on you.,
battlevoice_chr015_151,"Oops, was that too much? Sorry, you still in there? I could treat you to some K-BBQ!",
battlevoice_chr000_683,Hm? Isn't it unfair gearing up like that in the middle of town?,
battlevoice_chr000_684,What am I thinking? Just about the date, of course!,
battlevoice_chr003_675,"Phew. Practical battle experience, huh?",
battlevoice_chr003_676,(Wait is she being serious? Or is she just mad at me?),
battlevoice_chr003_677,I can say the same for you and the dangerous guards you have with you.,
battlevoice_chr005_653,"Wait-wait-wait, is that the real thing?",
battlevoice_chr005_654,Then how about a song? Perhaps you could play me a tarantella?,
battlevoice_chr005_655,"Well, it appears things must be quite fun on your end as well.",
battlevoice_chr008_691,Alrighty! Time to pretend I'm just showing off my skills so I can beat him up!,
battlevoice_chr008_692,"Oh wow, what an honor, ha-ha-ha...! Tch.",
battlevoice_chr010_683,"Maybe, I don't feel like drinking human blood in the slightest, though.",
battlevoice_chr010_684,Heheh. I think I just found my new favorite plaything.,
battlevoice_chr010_685,I remember telling you that I'd show no mercy next we meet.,
battlevoice_chr010_686,It was. It hurt so much you'd almost think my head had come off.,
battlevoice_chr010_687,"You're the leader. You should spill your own blood for once, Bestino",
battlevoice_chr011_793,"Undercover again, Acting Presbyter?",
battlevoice_chr011_794,"Worry not, I'm only fighting you as a mere Executor right now.",
battlevoice_chr014_119,"You're not getting away that easy, you little brat!",
battlevoice_chr014_109,"Hmph! You just don't know when to quit, do you?",
battlevoice_chr015_122,Pretty ancient weapons for a kid to be using.,
battlevoice_chr015_123,"Oh hey, you're quite the big shot, aren't you?",
battlevoice_chr015_124,"One little outlier isn't gonna hurt, right?",
battlevoice_chr016_100,No introductions. All I want to hear are your pleas for mercy.,
battlevoice_chr016_101,No need for excuses. Prepare yourself.,
battlevoice_chr016_102,"Disable the target and take them into custody, if they're still alive.",
battlevoice_chr016_103,You got a problem with my weapons?,
battlevoice_chr016_104,"Blaze, Blade, Break... Safety locks, disengaged.",
battlevoice_chr016_105,"I'm not here to play, time to go all out.",
battlevoice_chr016_106,Engage!,
battlevoice_chr016_107,I will guide the lost on to the true path.,
battlevoice_chr016_108,Time to confess your sins.,
battlevoice_chr016_109,This is the result of your own weakness.,
battlevoice_chr016_110,"So, you've become a Dead Apostle, Noel?",
battlevoice_chr016_111,The Fifth Magician... Fancy meeting you here.,
battlevoice_chr016_112,"Acting Prelate or not, if you get in my way, I'll eliminate you.",
battlevoice_chr016_113,"Feel free to stop me by force, if you can.",
battlevoice_chr016_114,"Of course it is. Your voyage end here, Michael Roa Valdamjong.",
battlevoice_chr016_120,Is there still life in you?,
battlevoice_chr016_121,Be glad you were blessed with great resilience.,
battlevoice_chr016_122,Running diagnostics... No serious damage.,
battlevoice_chr016_123,Did your life flash before your eyes?,
battlevoice_chr016_125,On your feet. The enemy won't wait.,
battlevoice_chr016_130,Interrogation complete.,
battlevoice_chr016_131,May the punishment fit the crime.,
battlevoice_chr016_132,What a shame. I expected more from you.,
battlevoice_chr016_133,Not a scratch on any of my gear. On to the next target.,
battlevoice_chr016_134,Are you prepared to face the consequences?,
battlevoice_chr016_135,How very predictable.,
battlevoice_chr016_136,"This will be your last life, Serpent of Akasha.",
battlevoice_chr016_700,"Looks like your sanity is at least still intact, even if by small margins.",
battlevoice_chr016_701,You've been consumed by your vampiric urges. How pitiful.,
battlevoice_chr016_702,"Oh I see, you like it when your ""playthings"" kill you.",
battlevoice_chr016_705,Feel free to enjoy your victory.,
battlevoice_chr016_706,I've no choice but to play my trump card...,
battlevoice_chr016_707,Stay calm... You can do this...,
battlevoice_chr016_710,"You're even more ""playful"" than usual.",
battlevoice_chr016_711,"You're like a broken faucet, running wild.",
battlevoice_chr016_712,A dump truck has more elegance than you.,
battlevoice_chr016_715,Even you won't be getting up from that.,
battlevoice_chr016_716,I take no pleasure in this victory... But I'll still go celebrate at Messiaen!,
battlevoice_chr016_717,I can't believe it... I did it! Take THAT!,
battlevoice_chr016_718,You're just a pathetic vampire. This is the end.,
battlevoice_chr016_750,Yes. Resist me with everything you've got.,
battlevoice_chr016_751,"Think of me as Arc-- I mean, just another vampire.",
battlevoice_chr016_760,It's fine. I'm not mad at all.,
battlevoice_chr016_761,This was only supposed to be a training exercise...,
battlevoice_chr016_762,"Hey now, don't make me get serious.",
battlevoice_chr016_770,Do you need me to heal your wounds?,
battlevoice_chr016_771,You put up a good fight.,
battlevoice_chr016_772,"Maybe I could use a knife to-- Uh, sorry, it's nothing.",
battlevoice_chr016_780,"Out cold... Could this be my chance...? No, no! I must remain chaste and clean!",
battlevoice_chr016_781,"It's important to eat after a fight. By the way, I have curry waiting at home...",
battlevoice_chr016_782,"Once you really get into it, you're like a different person...",
battlevoice_chr016_783,"You're not usually such a pushover, Shiki.",
battlevoice_chr017_100,This is my turf. I make the rules here.,
battlevoice_chr017_101,"Listen, and repent of your sins.",
battlevoice_chr017_102,This ensemble's far too short on performers.,
battlevoice_chr017_103,We'll welcome you into our faith anytime.,
battlevoice_chr017_104,Make this quick. I'm very busy.,
battlevoice_chr017_105,Go easy on me. I'm just a kid.,
battlevoice_chr017_106,Indecent in both looks and attitude. You're beyond saving.,
battlevoice_chr017_107,You were 100% useless. How did you become like this?,
battlevoice_chr017_108,"Sure, come at me and let me see watcha got.",
battlevoice_chr017_109,"You're 'boutta get reeducted by me personally, fatass.",
battlevoice_chr017_110,What? I happen to like the retro look.,
battlevoice_chr017_111,You're far too virtuous to be a Magician.,
battlevoice_chr017_112,You may be a genius but you know nothing about cooperation.,
battlevoice_chr017_113,I never signed off on taking control of the city!,
battlevoice_chr017_114,Yeah. My goons are all provin' a bit useless, so I ain't got much choice.,
