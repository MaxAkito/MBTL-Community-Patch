What a tiring person you are. 
My superiority has been clearly demonstrated. 
There's no need to continue this any further.
\e

WinMes01:
chara_type 1
That was enjoyable. I would gladly serve
as your opponent if there is ever a next time.
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 102
Would you look at that, I fight quite well, after all. 
If I'm this good, there's even no need for me to inverse.
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 101
The battle has been decided. 
You will find the exit over there. 
I suggest you use it while you're still alive.
\e

WinMes04:
chara_type 101
Ooh, you look dissatisfied. 
Do you perhaps wish to try again? 
The outcome will remain unchanged for all eternity, though.
\e

WinMes05:
chara_type 0
That will have to do.
Heh, perhaps I acted a bit immodestly?
\e

WinMes06:
chara_type 104
Battle isn't about power, 
it's about having technique and a keen mind. 
I'm sure you've grasped that well enough by now.
\e

WinMes07:
chara_type 1
How silly of me.
Just what was I thinking of gaining 
from proving my superiority like this?
\e

WinMes08:
chara_type 2
Thank you. This has proved a great diversion.
How about it? Would you perhaps consider 
serving as my opponent once a week or so?
\e

WinMes09:
chara_type 102
How was it? I only started practicing my dance moves
recently, but I think I'm learning quickly.
\e

WinMes10:
chara_type 1
Oh dear, those injuries look nasty. Don't worry, 
I'll have someone see to your wounds right away. 
Oh, but be careful. She has a habit of over-medicating.
\e

WinMes11:
chara_type 2
Well, that was a productive use of my time.
Do take care.

See, Shiki? If I put my mind to it, 
I can fight too. Promise to ask me 
for help the next time you need it, all right?

Why do you keep leaving the mansion without permission?!
This is the last time! If you do it again I'll put you 
on a secluded island until you've reflected on your actions.

This goes without saying, but you two understand that 
you'll be receiving a pay cut for this, right? At minimum.

Kohaku, I will tolerate your outrageous behavior no longer! 
You will take down the surveillance cameras you've installed 
and destroy your questionable medicine immediately!

For what it's worth, you're a daughter of the Arima family, 
no? Once you're in middle school, you'll be attending 
Asagami Academy, so make sure you act more refine--
What? You don't plan on attending Asagami Academy?!

Three wins isn't bad. 
This is proving to be quite the useful training session.
\e

WinMes10WinStreak00:
chara_type 2
Ten wins?! That's amazing! *ahem* Excuse me. 
What I meant to say was, you would be most 
welcome at our estate should you be so interested.
