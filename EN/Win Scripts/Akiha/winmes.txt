How boring. I've seen enough.
There is no reason to continue.
\e


WinMes01:
chara_type 1
That was enjoyable. I would be more than happy
to beat you again whenever you like.
\e


WinMes02:
chara_type 102
I'm even more impressive than I thought. If I'm this good,
there's no reason to ever refuse to fight.
\e


WinMes03:
chara_type 101
This battle has been decided. You will find the exit over
there. I suggest you use it while you're still alive.
\e


WinMes04:
chara_type 101
You look rather upset. I would be happy to
go another round if you wish, though the
outcome will remain unchanged.
\e


WinMes05:

I think that's quite far enough. I'm not sure
your pride can take much more.
\e


WinMes06:
chara_type 104
A battle isn't all about strength. Technique and a keen mind
are equally as important. It's a shame you have neither.
\e


WinMes07:
chara_type 1
I must be a fool. Once again I prove myself superior,
and once again I gain nothing from doing so.
What an absolute waste of my time.
\e


WinMes08:
chara_type 2
Thank you for that change of pace. How would you like to
be my punching bag once a week from now on?
\e


WinMes09:
chara_type 102
How was that? I only started practicing my dance moves
recently, but I think I'm learning quickly.
\e


WinMes10:
chara_type 1
Oh dear, you don't look so good. Don't worry, I'll have
someone see to your wounds right away. Oh, but
be careful. She has a habit of over-medicating.
\e


WinMes11:
chara_type 2
Well, that was a productive use of my time.
Do take care.

See? If I put my mind to it, I can fight too. Promise to ask
me for help the next time you need it, all right?

Why do you keep leaving the mansion without permission?!
If you do it again, I'm going to ship you off to an island
by yourself until you learn some manners!

This goes without saying, but you will both be receiving
a pay cut starting tomorrow.

Kohaku, I will tolerate your indulgences no longer! You will
take down the surveillance cameras you installed and
destroy your questionable medicines immediately!

You are a member of the Arima family, correct? In that case,
be sure you learn some manners once you've enrolled at
Asagami Academy in a couple years. What? You don't
plan on attending the academy?!

Three wins isn't bad. This sure is proving to be quite
the useful training session.
\e


WinMes10WinStreak00:

Ten wins?! That's amazing! *ahem* Excuse me. What I
meant to say was, you would be most welcome as a
member of my house should you be interested.
