That's that, then.
Maybe we'll meet again, if fate decrees it.

Hey, you've recovered from your injuries, right?
Using up that kind of stamina won't keep you down long.
Rest up for a day and you'll be good as new.
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 7
Mm-mmm! That felt great!
Thanks for the workout!
My stiff shoulders feel nice and loose now.

You haven't had enough, have you?
You should try new things every now and then.
Sticking too close to a routine
can dull your mind.

By the way, if you see an artsy girl with glasses
who's always smoking, punch her for me.
That's what she gets for embezzling money under my name.

That was more like an all-out battle than a friendly bout.
Breaking out the firearms was a bit much, don't you think?
As a cultured and dignified lady, I naturally prefer
hand-to-hand combat. Ohohoho!

It's too bad there aren't so many music stores around anymore.
I'm really in the mood for a new guitar, one of those nice
electric blue ones they had in the eighties...

I won't take your life, or your wallet.
How about you take me to dinner instead?
I'm in the mood for barbeque...or maybe a mixed grill.
Then again, you can't beat a good old-fashioned steak!
\e

WinMes08:
chara_type 100
You look so gloomy. Want to come away with me?
Exploring the seven seas beholden to no one has a way
of making your troubles disappear, believe me.

Don't try to make excuses. You picked the wrong person to
mess with, that's all there is to it. And against opponents
like you, I know I don't have to hold back.
\e

//対志貴
WinMes10:
chara_type 100
You still have a ways to go before you grow into the man
you're destined to be. Adieu for now. I look forward to seeing
you in some other backwater town sometime in the future.

That's all for today's lesson!
I realize I'm not one to talk, but you really need to work on
reining in your power a little more.

Lightning and vampiric strength? What a combination.
Despite how you look, you're really a very orthodox apostle.
Feels like you still have more up your sleeve, though.
Care to show me?

Oh geez, he's dead already?
I wanted to ask him how his
endless reincarnation works!
There goes my bonus!

Looks like she got away...
Where have they been hiding that one?
She's got a ton of potential, but her skills
are still unpolished... I can relate to that.

You're on fire now!
And this is only the beginning!

Congrats on your tenth win!
But you can still do better, right?
I admire a little perseverance.
Quitting while you're ahead is more my style, though.
