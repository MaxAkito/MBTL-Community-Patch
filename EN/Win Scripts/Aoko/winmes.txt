See ya!
Let us meet again, should fate so decree.

WinMes01:
chara_type 100
Your injuries are fine now, right?
I took the liberty of using your stamina for them so
if you just rest for a day or so you'll be as good as new. 
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 7
Mm-mmm! That felt great!
Thanks a lot, this has made for quite the workout!
My stiff shoulders feel nice and loose now.

Aren't you a bit too stuck up?
You should try new things every now and then.
Being so by-the-book all the 
time's gonna dull your mind.
\e

By the way, if you see an artsy girl with glasses
who's always smoking, punch her for me. Then tell her to 
stop using my name to take out money from the Association.

That was more like being on a battlefield than 
having a fight? I didn't have to turn into a shootout?
But I had to! As a sophisticated and cultured lady, 
a fistfight would just be all too undignified a sight. 
O-ho-ho-ho!
\e

WinMes06:

It's too bad there aren't that many music stores in this era.
I'm really in the mood for a new electric guitar...
One of those nice blue ones they had in the 80's...

I won't take your wallet--I mean, your life.
So, how about you take me out for dinner instead?
A yakiniku place would be nice... or maybe something Mongolian?
Oh, or maybe a steakhouse!
\e

WinMes08:
chara_type 100
Don't look so down. How about you come with me?
Exploring the seven seas beholden to no one has a way
of making your troubles disappear, believe me.

You're telling me you were in bad form? That's not it.
You just messed with the wrong person, that's all.
I mean, against you people I know I don't have to hold back.
\e

//対志貴
WinMes10:
chara_type 100
You still have a little ways to go before you become the 
lovely man I'd hoped for. Adieu for now. We'll meet again, 
probably somewherein the middle of nowhere. 
I'll look forward to it.

That's all for today's lesson!
I realize I'm not one to talk, but the way you're using
your power is all wrong.

Gematria-based lightning together with vampiric strength.
Despite appearances, you're quite the orthodox Dead Apostle.
Feels like you still have something else up your sleeve, though.
Care to show me?

Oh, oops. I killed him!?
I needed to interrogate him about his
secret to immortality or whatever! Nooooo!
Guess I can say goodbye to my bonus.

Drats, looks like she got away...
What was that? The hidden daugther of some Ancestor?
She's got the potential of a Greater Dead Apostle
but she fights like a total newbie. 
It almost reminds me of myself...

You're on fire now!
Let's keep it going!

Congrats on your ten consecutive wins!
But you still wanna keep going, right?
There's nothing wrong to keep going until you win...
Though I'd rather run away with the win so I never lose.
