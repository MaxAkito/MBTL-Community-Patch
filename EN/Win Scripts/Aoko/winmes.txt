That's that, then.
Let us meet again, should fate so decree.

Your injuries are fine now, right?
I took the liberty of using your stamina for it so
if you just rest for a day or so you'll be as good as new. 
\e

WinMes02:

Mm-mmm! That felt great!
Thanks for the workout!
My stiff shoulders feel nice and loose now.

You haven't had enough, have you?
You should try new things every now and then.
Sticking too close to a routine
can dull your mind.

By the way, if you see an artsy girl with glasses
who's always smoking, punch her for me. That's what she gets
for using my name to take out money from the Association.

That was more like being on a battlefield than having a fight?
Even for a shootout that was going overboard?
But of course! As a sophisticated and cultured lady, a fistfight would
just be all too undignified a sight. Ohohoho!

It's too bad there aren't so many music stores around anymore.
I'm really in the mood for a new guitar, one of those nice
electric blue ones they had in the 80's...

I won't take your wallet- I mean, your life.
So, how about you take me out for dinner in exchange?
A yakiniku place would be nice... or maybe something Mongolian?
Oh, a steakhouse would be great too!
\e

WinMes08:
chara_type 100
You look so gloomy. Want to come with me?
Exploring the seven seas beholden to no one has a way
of making your troubles disappear, believe me.

Don't try to make excuses. You picked the wrong person to
mess with, that's all there is to it. And against opponents
like you, I know I don't have to hold back.

WinMes10:
chara_type 100
You still have a ways to go before you grow into the man
you're destined to be. Adieu for now. I look forward to seeing
you in some other backwater town sometime in the future.

That's all for today's lesson!
I realize I'm not one to talk, but the way you're using
your power is all wrong.

Lightning born from numerology together with vampiric strength.
He was really a very orthodox Apostle despite appearances.
Feels like you still have more up your sleeve, though.
Care to show me?

Oh geez, he's dead already?
I wanted to ask him how his
endless reincarnation works!
There goes my bonus!

Looks like she got away...
Where have they been hiding that one?
She's got a ton of potential, but her skills
are still unpolished... I can relate to that.

Congrats on your tenth win!
But you can still do better, right?
I admire a little perseverance.
Quitting while you're ahead is more my style, though.
