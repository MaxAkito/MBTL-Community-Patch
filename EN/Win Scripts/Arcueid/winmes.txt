That's a wrap!
Who's next? ô
\e


WinMes01:
chara_type 0
That was mew easy!
\e


WinMes02:
chara_type 103
Sorry, but your chances of winning were zero.
Maybe try again in your next life.
\e


WinMes03:
chara_type 102
Still not giving up? Fine...
I'll just have to crush you a little harder next time.
You know, like a vampire.
\e


WinMes04:
chara_type 102
You're asking if I'll drink your blood? I would appreciate
it if you didn't mistake me for some third-rate vampire.
\e


WinMes05:
chara_type 104
Not bad. I had to get a little serious there.
I look forward to next time.
\e


WinMes06:
chara_type 104
Perhaps I stayed out in the sun too long. Actually breaking
a sweat against someone like you must mean my abilities
are getting weaker.
\e


WinMes07:
chara_type 103
Oh dear, is it over already? You're not
as strong as you look.
\e


WinMes08:
chara_type 100
Ahh, that felt great! ô
Like that feeling you get standing under a blue sky after
deflecting a missile, you know? Not that I've ever done
anything like that before, mind you.
\e


WinMes09:
chara_type 100
You want to go again? I suppose that was amusing
enough that I can go another round.
And this time I won't hold back!
\e


WinMes10:
chara_type 103
Sometimes I just don't understand you people.
Why do you continue to throw your lives away
when you know you can't win?
\e


WinMes11:
chara_type 102
Jump, turn around, throw a punch, and it's over.
Hm, is this what dancing at a ball is like?

Heheh. So you changed your mind about me?
Even when you're serious, I won't lose! ô

You may have become an Ancestor, but you
should still remember your manners. It let's
others know what kind of parents raised you.
\e

WinMes14:
chara_type 100
You're getting sharper day by day.
Shiki might be bothered by it, but
I quite enjoy gaining more playmates.
\e

WinMes15:
chara_type 101
Ugh, how annoying. It never ends!
Just go away already, Ciel.
Keep this up, and you're not
the only one who'll suffer.
\e

WinMes16:
chara_type 103
Farewell, my first love! Are you satisfied?
Not only did I spill your blood this time,
but I also tore your soul to shreds!
\e

WinMes17:
chara_type 103
You're one of the mixed-bloods of this country, aren't you?
You have some human in you, but you're still more
beast than human. How have you survived this long?

All right! Three wins in a row!
I just need to keep this up!
\e


WinMes10WinStreak00:
chara_type 0
I'm amazing! Ten wins in a row! It just...
Ahhh... feels so good, you know?!
