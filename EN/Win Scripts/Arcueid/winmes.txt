That's a wrap!
Who's next? ô
\e

WinMes01:
chara_type 0
That was mew easy!
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 103
Sorry, but your chances of winning were zero.
Maybe try again in your next life.
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 102
Still not giving up? Fine...
I'll just have to break you a little more brutally next time.
You know, as a vampire should.
\e

WinMes04:
chara_type 102
You're asking if I'll drink your blood? Very funny. I would 
appreciate it if you didn't mistake me for some third-rate vampire.
\e


WinMes05:
chara_type 104
Not bad. I had to get a little serious there.
I look forward to next time, if there is one.
\e


WinMes06:
chara_type 104
Perhaps I stayed out in the sun too long. Actually breaking
a sweat against someone like you must mean my abilities
are getting weaker.
\e

WinMes07:
chara_type 103
Oh dear, is it over already? 
You're not as strong as you look.
\e

WinMes08:
chara_type 100
Ahh, that felt great! ô
Like that feeling you get standing under a blue sky after
deflecting a missile, you know? Not that I've ever done
anything like that before, mind you.
\e

WinMes09:
chara_type 100
You want to go again? I suppose that was amusing
enough that I can go another round.
And this time I won't hold back!
\e

WinMes10:
chara_type 103
Sometimes I just don't understand you people.
Why do you continue to throw your lives away
when you know you can't win?
\e

WinMes11:
chara_type 102
Jump, turn around, throw a punch, and it's over.
Hm, is this what dancing at a ball is like?

Heheh. So, did I impress you this time?
From now on I won't lose even when you're serious, Shiki ô
\e

WinMes13:
chara_type 103
You may have just became an Ancestor, 
but you should still know some manners.
It reflects poorly on the sire who bequeathed you their Principle.
\e

// ‘ÎH—t
WinMes14:
chara_type 100
You're getting sharper day by day.
Shiki might be bothered by it, but
I quite enjoy gaining more playmates.
\e

WinMes15:
chara_type 101
Ugh, how annoying. It never ends!
Just go away already, Ciel.
Keep this up, and the casualities 
won't stop at just you.
\e

// ‘ÎƒƒA
WinMes16:
chara_type 103
Farewell, my very first! Were you satisfied?
Not only did I spill your blood this time,
but I also tore you along with your your soul to shreds!
\e

// ‘ÎçaŠÔ
WinMes17:
chara_type 103
You're one of this countries old hybrids aren't you?
There's some human mixed in, but the quality of your blood is 
Phantasmal Beast class. Just how was that preserved?

All right! Three wins in a row!
I just need to keep this up!
\e

WinMes10WinStreak00:
chara_type 0
I'm amazing! Ten wins in a row! It just...
Ahhh... feels so good, you know?!
