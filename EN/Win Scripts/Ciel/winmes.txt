It's because you resist that you get hurt.
How about you learn from this and become a bit more obedient?
\e

I doubt you wish to die any more than I do. I'll let you
go with a warning this time, so please take the time to repent.
\e

Our difference in skill is clear. Maybe now you understand that I 
wasn't granted the title of seventh in the Burial Agency for nothing.

Lord God Almighty, thy Will is that which I Execute.
There, Execution Complete.
Time to head over to Messiaen!
\e

WinMes04:
chara_type 100
This fight has gone on long enough. 
You should use the time you have left to repent.
\e

WinMes05:
chara_type 101
Oh? Done already?
You sure give up quickly for someone who talks so big.
\e


WinMes06:
chara_type 100
Phew...
Allow me to commend you.
You are quite the formidable opponent.

Great, I've torn my nun's habit again. 
That makes the seventh one this month.
Ms. Noel, could I entrust with some needlework?
\e

WinMes08:
chara_type 1
Finally decided to accept defeat?
Hopefully we can do things a bit more peacefully the next time we meet.
\e

WinMes09:
chara_type 103
My nun's habit feels awfully light for some reason...
I wonder if I used too many Black Keys. 
Wait, wasn't I badly over budget this month?
\e

WinMes10:
chara_type 100
Evil possessing man is but a tribulation from Heaven.
Now begone, defector. 
The scales of judgment have passed their decree.

Ordinary citizens such as yourself should not be out
wandering the streets this late. How about you come
back to my place to reflect on your actions, Shiki?

Finished already? Your movements have really started to drag.
Did you gain a few pounds of extra fat from depending on a 
certain someone too much?
\e

// 対秋葉
WinMes13:
chara_type 100
That was certainly unexpected. I would not have thought
someone without any combat training could survive that long
against me. Your skill could prove deadly if left unchecked.

You still have much to learn. 
Greatness is not something that can be rushed. 
For now, how about you take a day or two to
reflect on what happened here?
\e

WinMes15:
chara_type 100
The hand of death has finally snaked itself around your throat.
I will not allow you to reincarnate again.
\e

chara_type 105
I know you've had your blood sucked by a Dead Apostle, 
but this sudden spurt of growth shouldn't be possible...
What on earth happened to you, Sister Noel...?

Your youthful delusions of grandeur must be eradicated!
You think that sounded awfully personal?
Of course not~ It's just that I'm a member of the Holy Church.
Defeating members of the Mages Association is part of my job.

Ten wins in a row! How splendid!
Let's throw a party in celebration!
I'll order my usual...
