It's because you resist that you get hurt.
How about you learn from this and become a bit more obedient?
\e

WinMes01:
chara_type 0
I doubt you wish to die any more than I do. I'll let you
go with a warning this time, but only if you repent.
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 100
This is the difference between our abilities. Do you now understand 
that my title of Seven in the Burial Agency is not just for show?
\e

WinMes03:

Lord God Almighty, thy Will is that which I Execute.
There, Execution Complete.
Time to head over to Messiaen!
\e

WinMes04:
chara_type 100
This fight has gone on long enough. 
You should use the time you have left to repent.
\e

WinMes05:
chara_type 101
Oh? Done already?
You sure give up quickly for someone who talks so big.
\e


WinMes06:
chara_type 100
Phew...
Allow me to commend you.
You are quite the formidable opponent.
\e

WinMes07:
chara_type 103
Great, I've torn my habit again. 
That makes the seventh one this month.
Ms. Noel, could I entrust with some needlework?
\e

WinMes08:
chara_type 1
Finally decided to accept defeat?
Hopefully we can do things a bit more peaceful the next time we meet.
\e

WinMes09:
chara_type 103
My habit feels awfully light for some reason...
I wonder if I used too many Black Keys. 
How much did I have left in the budget this month again?
\e

WinMes10:
chara_type 100
Evil possessing man is but a tribulation from Heaven.
Now begone, defector. 
You have already fallen from such scales of judgment.
\e

Ordinary citizens such as yourself should not be out
wandering the streets this late. How about you come
back to my place to reflect on your actions, Shiki?
\e

// 対アルクェイド
WinMes12:
chara_type 102
Finished already? It looks like you've put on a few pounds,
too. You haven't been letting a certain someone spoil you
too much lately, have you?
\e

// 対秋葉
WinMes13:
chara_type 100
That was certainly unexpected. I would not have thought
someone without any battle training could survive that long
against me. Your skill could prove deadly if left unchecked.
\e

// 対秋葉、翡翠、琥珀、ヒスコハ　※特に琥珀用
WinMes14:
chara_type 1
You still have much to learn. Greatness is not
something that can be rushed. For now,
how about you take a day or two to
reflect on what happened here?
\e

// 対ロア
WinMes15:
chara_type 100
I will not allow you to reincarnate again.
The hand of death has finally snaked itself around your throat
\e

// 対死徒ノエル
WinMes16:
chara_type 105
Even after having your blood sucked
by a Dead Apostle, this level of growth is unreal.
What on earth happened to you, Sister Noel...?
\e

Your youthful delusions of grandeur must be eradicated!
You think that sounded awfully personal?
Of course not~ I'm just a member of the Holy Church, so...
Defeating members of the Mage's Association is part of the job.

Three consecutive wins?
The Lord is surely pleased.
\e

Ten wins in a row! How splendid!
Let's have a party in celebration then!
I'll order my usual...
\e
