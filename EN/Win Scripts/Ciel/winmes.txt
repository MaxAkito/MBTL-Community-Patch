WinMes00:
chara_type 102
The more you resist, the more it's going to hurt. How many
times is it going to take before you learn your lesson?
\e


WinMes01:
chara_type 0
I doubt you wish to die any more than I do. I'll let you
go with a warning this time, but only if you repent.
\e


WinMes02:
chara_type 100
Has this little demonstration of my power convinced you I
deserve the title of Number Seven of the Burial Agency?
\e


WinMes03:

Holy Father, Your will shall be done. There! All finished!
Being an executor sure works up an appetite!
Time to head over to Messiaen!
\e


WinMes04:
chara_type 100
This fight has gone on long enough. You should use the time
you have left to repent.
\e


WinMes05:
chara_type 101
Oh? Is the fight over already? I'm surprised you're able to
accept your failure with such grace after all that big talk.
\e


WinMes06:
chara_type 100
Phew...
That demonstration of yours deserves to be praised.
You are quite the formidable opponent.
\e


WinMes07:
chara_type 103
Great, I've torn my robe again. That's the seventh one
this month. Ms. Noel, would you mind terribly if I asked
you to mend it for me?
\e


WinMes08:
chara_type 1
Finally decided to accept defeat? I hope we can avoid such
useless fighting the next time we meet.
\e


WinMes09:
chara_type 103
My robe feels awfully light for some reason. I wonder if
I used the black keys too much. How much did I have
left in the budget this month again?
\e


WinMes10:
chara_type 100
Demons are merely a test sent by Heaven.
Now begone, quitter. You have
already fallen from the scales of justice.
\e

Ordinary citizens such as yourself should not be out
wandering the streets this late. How about you come
back to my place to reflect on your actions, Shiki?
\e


// 対アルクェイド
WinMes12:
chara_type 102
Finished already? It looks like you've put on a few pounds,
too. You haven't been letting a certain someone spoil you
too much lately, have you?
\e


// 対秋葉
WinMes13:
chara_type 100
That was certainly unexpected. I would not have thought
someone without any battle training could survive that long
against me. Your skill could prove deadly if left unchecked.
\e

WinMes14:
chara_type 1
You still have much to learn. Greatness is not
something that can be rushed. For now,
how about you take a couple days to
reflect on what happened here?
\e

// 対ロア
WinMes15:
chara_type 100
I will not allow you to reincarnate again.
Death has finally caught up to you, Serpent!
\e

// 対死徒ノエル
WinMes16:
chara_type 105
Even after having your blood sucked
by a Dead Apostle, this level of growth is unreal.
What on earth happened to you, Sister Noel...?
\e

Your youthful delusions of grandeur must be nipped in the bud!
Nothing personal, of course.
I'm a member of the Holy Church, after all.
Defeating magicians is part of the job.

Three consecutive wins?
The Lord would be pleased.
\e

Ten wins in a row! How splendid!
We should celebrate!
I'll order my usual...
