Aww, dead already?
I wanted to play with you some more...
Ha! Just kidding.
Really think I'd have time to waste on trash like you?

Take a look, my wounds are completely healed!\sf000
Seems all your efforts, even your entire life up until
this point was all for nothing, huh?
Ahaha, you struggled so desperately too! You poor little thing.

//対人間
WinMes02:
chara_type 1
Did you really think a mere human would
stand a chance against me? After I'd turned into a vampire?
In your dreams. 
\e

//対死徒
WinMes03:
chara_type 6
Wow, and I haven't even been an vampire all that long.
How embarassing. Doesn't it make you just wanna disappear?
Hehe... that at least I can arrange for you.
\e

WinMes04:
chara_type 1
Ugh, boooring...
Whatever happened to the thrill of the fight I used to feel?
Guess I'll have to find some stronger opponents
if I want to get any real enjoyment out of it.
\e

WinMes05:
chara_type 8
How's it feel? My Principle is the Bell of Nostalgia.
A bell of christmas that conjures memories of happier times
and is as merciless as the feeling of growing up.
\e

WinMes06:
chara_type 106
Hmph, you're not bad. But I've lost my patience so I'll 
let you go for now. Don't worry. In seven days 
I'll exact my sweet revenge upon you\sf000

Hm...
You know, this fight taught me an important lesson.
I'd better write it down so I don't forget...
\e

//対シエル
WinMes08:
chara_type 2
Huh? That's odd... I mean, really. 
You're unkillable... that was what you were good for, it's what 
I hated, and its what would bring you atonement. So hurry up 
already. Hurry up! Aren't you supposed to let me kill you some more?
\e

//対志貴
WinMes09:
chara_type 8
Well, Shiki? How do you like these Mystic Eyes of Roses?
With these, I can make you experience
anything I can think of.\sf000

WinMes10:
chara_type 102
Ugh... Well, he's dead, at least...
But now he'll just come back again...
Damn it...
What am I even doing?!

That's right, this whole thing was just a dream...
A nightmare of my very own creation.
You should be grateful, Shiki.
This is my way of taking pity on you.

WinMesArcadeWin04:
chara_type 101
Hmm... So this is what vampire blood is made out of, huh? 
It's called "Ether," right? Being able to materalize it at
will is great and all, but isn't it kind of inconvenient 
that it's restricted to the shape of the soul?
\e

What's wrong? You sure died easily.
C'mon, why don't you reincarnate or something?
See if I care!
