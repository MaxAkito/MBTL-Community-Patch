Aww, dead already?
I wanted to play with you some more...
Ha! Just kidding.
You're so weak, you're not even worth toying with!

Take a look, my wounds are completely healed!\sf000
How does that make you feel? Like everything
you've done up until now was meaningless?
Hahaha! Congratulations, you've totally wasted your life!

WinMes02:
chara_type 1
Did you really think a human would
stand a chance against a vampire?
Quit dreaming and face reality!

Wow, and I haven't even been an apostle all that long.
This must be sooo humiliating for you!
But don't worry, I'll put you out of your misery soon enough!
\e

WinMes04:
chara_type 1
Ugh, boooring...
Whatever happened to the thrill of the fight I used to feel?
Guess I'll have to find some stronger opponents
if I want to get any real enjoyment out of it.

Nostalgia can be a double-edged sword.
Once you grow up, the memories of happier times
can cut you deeper than any blade.

WinMes06:
chara_type 106
Hey, you're not bad. I think I'll let you go.
But I'll hunt you down seven days from now
and pay you back for this a thousandfold!\sf000

Hm...
You know, this fight taught me an important lesson.
I'd better write it down so I don't forget...

WinMes08:
chara_type 2
Huh? That's weird... I thought you were supposed to be
practically invincible? It shouldn't take you any time at all
to regenerate from something like this.
Hurry up and get back on your feet so I can kill you again!
\e

//対志貴
WinMes09:
chara_type 8
Well, Shiki? How do you like my Mystic Eyes?
With these, I can make you experience
anything I can think of.\sf000

WinMes10:
chara_type 102
Ugh... Well, he's dead, at least...
But now he'll just come back again...
Damn it...
What am I even doing?!

That's right, this whole thing was just a dream...
a nightmare I constructed especially for you, Shiki.
You should be grateful.
This is my way of taking pity on you.

So this is the power vampire blood holds. It's called
"ether," right? Being able to materialize whatever
you want is great and all, but it kind of sucks being
limited by the form your soul takes.

I don't believe it, how could you die so easily?
C'mon, why don't you reincarnate or something?
It makes no difference to me!
