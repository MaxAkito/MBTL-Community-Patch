Um, are you all right?
\e



WinMes01:
chara_type 2
Oh, my. I am terribly sorry. I'm not very comfortable
with others touching me...
\e



WinMes02:
chara_type 101
You seemed as if you wanted an earnest fight, so I
gave it everything I could.
\e



WinMes03:
chara_type 100
D-Did I win...? Master Shiki! Look!
I did it!
\e



WinMes04:
chara_type 102
Phew! Now, if you'll excuse me, I should
get back to cleaning.
\e



WinMes05:
chara_type 1
I beg your pardon. You just
seemed so intense that I felt it
necessary to defend myself.
\e



WinMes06:
chara_type 101
That was rather frightening.
I must ask that you don't try that again.
\e

Was that satisfactory? I'm afraid fighting
is not my strong point.
\e


WinMes09:
chara_type 102
You should fix that temper of yours. Learning some
proper manners would be good for you.

Please forgive me, Master Shiki. I realize it may have
been a bit excessive, but this was the only way I
could think of to make you return to your room...

chara_type 1
You seemed as if you wanted an earnest fight, so I
did not hold back. Was it satisfactory, Lady Akiha?
\e

WinMes12:
chara_type 100
I'm sorry, Kohaku. I sensed an unusual
amount of blood lust coming from you.
I had to snap you out of it.
\e


// 対アルクェイド
WinMes13:
chara_type 100
Th-That was close...
What happened, anyway? Why did I sense such a
dangerous aura emanating from Miss Arcueid?
