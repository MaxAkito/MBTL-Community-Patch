There we go, all cleaned up.
I know you're just bursting with energy, 
but no more pranks, 'kay?

An overwhelming victory for me! 
Yaaay, even without Hisui I'm invincible!

We should be trying to get along instead of fighting. 
I'll prepare some tea for when you regain consciousness,
so feel free to sleep as long as you need to! ô

Uh-oh, that's not very safe!
You know what we do with dangerous things like that?
Into the trash it goes!

Please use the main entrance next time. 
That way I might give you an even warmer welcome.

Surprised? 
I am a maid under the employ of the Tohno family, 
you know. We all have some degree of grounding in
the etiquette of battle.

Was it to your liking? Heheh... 
I will be sure to bring an even stronger 
dose of medicine for you next time.

The best medicine is bitter. The truth hurts... 
So now that you have learned your lesson, 
I expect to see an improvement in your behavior.

I'm quite impressed with myself!
Alright! I'll train even harder, seize 
control of the mansion and-- I-I mean,
My duty is to protect Lady Akiha and Shiki!

I took the liberty of treating your wounds. 
Feel free to come back once you feel better.

I'm terribly sorry for being so rough, Shiki. 
Allow me to apologize by preparing a meal for you. 
C'mon, let's get going to the dining hall.

Heehee. Seems I've won this time, Lady Akiha. 
Don't forget our agreement. I get to install more surveillance 
cameras and will receive a larger budget for Shiki's medicine! ô

Looks like I win, Hisui.
As promised, I'll take over the 
cleaning duties of the mansion now! ô
