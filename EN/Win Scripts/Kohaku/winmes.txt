That's enough cleaning for one day. 
I would appreciate it if you stopped with the childish pranks.

An overwhelming victory for me! 
Yaaay, even without Hisui I'm invincible!

We should be trying to get along instead of fighting. I'll
prepare some tea for when y	ou regain consciousness,
so feel free to sleep as long as you need to! ô

That was rather dangerous. Such behavior should be
discarded like the previous night's refuse!

Please use the main entrance next time. 
That way I might give you an even warmer welcome.

Surprised? 
I am a maid under the employ of the Tohno family, you know. 
We take great pride in our impeccable manners.

WinMes06:

Was that to your satisfaction? I will be sure to bring an
even stronger dose of medicine for you next time.
\e

WinMes07:
chara_type 1
Good medicine is bitter and the truth hurts, is what they say.
But now that you have learned your lesson, 
I expect to see an improvement in your behavior.

That was quite the battle. I'll train even harder,
seize control of the mansion and-- I-I mean,
My duty is to protect Lady Akiha and Shiki!
\e

WinMes09:

I took the liberty of treating your wounds. 
Feel free to come back for another round once you feel better.

I'm terribly sorry for being so rough, Shiki. 
Allow me to apologize by preparing a meal for you. 
C'mon, let's get going to the dining hall.

Heehee. Seems I've won this time, Lady Akiha. 
Don't forget our agreement. I get to install more surveillance cameras 
and will receive a larger budget for Shiki's medicine! ô

Looks like I win, Hisui.
As agreed, you will take over my cleaning duties
for the next week! ô
