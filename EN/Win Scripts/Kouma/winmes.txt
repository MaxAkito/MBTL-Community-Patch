WinMes00:

Am I looking for an assistant? No, but I'll be happy to
give you a nice send-off. It may be a bit crude, though.
\e


WinMes01:
chara_type 1
How reckless. You're still far from understanding all
three thousand realms in a single moment.
\e


WinMes02:
chara_type 0
There is nothing innately good or bad about killing. It's
arrogant to assume you must define what is evil.
\e


WinMes03:
chara_type 0
What was that? An ape is more evolved than you are.
\e


WinMes04:
chara_type 0

Not bad. If you're ever itching for another fight,
feel free to come find me.

WinMes06:

Are you sure you're human?

And it does not matter if it produces no fruit
or becomes a poisonous weed, for you have
already judged both to be evil.

You are a most bizarre woman. You may
be regarded as a holy figure somewhere,
but not in this country.

I once knew a pair of sisters who resembled you two.
I'm going to need you to leave.

Unfortunately, I do not see things the same way you do.
I regret nothing. In fact, I have committed no sin at all.
If you wish to settle this, come back when you can kill me.

Three wins in a row is proof of your skill.
I see you've trained well.

Ten wins in a row is quite impressive. If this were a
tournament, it would already be over.
