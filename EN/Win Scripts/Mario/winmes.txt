Fuckin' hell, losing to a little kid like me.
And I ain't talking 'bout strength, but your noggin'.
Hit the books before you challenge me again.

All I got goin' for me is my youth.
Honor does not apply to me and I can shamelessly ask
adults for help beating people up.

You'll remain a shitter for the rest 'a your life if all you do is 
depend on your own skills. We all got shit we can't do ourselves.
So you gotta force others to do it for you. You get me?
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 305
You can't just hope you'll fuckin' win.
I'mma part 'a the gamer generation, I can read your every move.

This Piano Machine was originally a silk loom.
Now it weaves people instead, controlling and strengthening them.
My old man used to gaze longingly at
it in the store window when he was just a boy...

Being a kid's real nice, socially speaking. Can just pick as many
fights as I want. Sorry, talkin' to myself here.
Don't worry about it. Go take a nap, kid.

WinMes06:

Always had a knack for violence. 
Much more useful than Theology, at least.
The times I get to use it have gone down
the shitter ever since I became Acting Presbyter though.

Keep it within our monthly budget, though.
