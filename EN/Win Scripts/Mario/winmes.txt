Aren't you ashamed, losing to a kid like me?
It's a matter of strategy, not strength.
Hit the books before you challenge me again.
\e

WinMes01:
chara_type 104
It's nice to be so young.
Honor does not apply to me and I can shamelessly ask
adults for help beating people up.
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 100
Technique will only get you so far.
We all have things we can't do ourselves.
So why not force others to take up the slack?
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 305
You'll never win by just powering through it.
Don't underestimate the gamer generation!

I modified this Piano Machine from an old loom.
Now it weaves the threads of fate instead.
My old man used to gaze longingly at
it in the store window when he was just a boy.

It's nice being a kid and picking fights like
it's no big deal. Hm? Nothing, just talking to myself.
Time to say goodnight, kid.
\e

WinMes06:
chara_type 100
I've always had a talent for violence.
It's so much more efficient than empty preaching.
Weirdly, I haven't had much of a chance to cut
loose like this since becoming Acting Prelate.

All right, we're heading back.
You need anything before we go?
Fine, I guess we can stop by the store.
Nothing too expensive, all right?
\e

// 対一般人(ヒスコハは除外した方が良さそう)
WinMes08:
chara_type 306
Soprano, contact Karius.
Tell him we've got a prisoner that needs detaining.
See to their wounds as well, if you have time.
\e

//対死徒（非人間）
WinMes09:
chara_type 303
Alto, contact Undeux.
Tell him we've got some trash that needs disposing of.
And don't forget to check for and treat any victims you find.
\e

//対志貴

That's odd.
I had so much more planned for this battle.
I guess this is the best I can expect from a mere human.
Maybe this is a lesson better learned young...
\e

//対アルクェイド
WinMes11:
chara_type 304

chara_switchframe 260
I may have won, but I had to cast aside
my usual strategy to do it.
What happened to make you so different?!
\e

//対暴走アルクェイド
WinMes12:
chara_type 305
These monsters just come back stronger after death.
I don't have time for this!
Fall back! We're leaving.
\e

// 対シエル
WinMes13:
chara_type 100
Don't look so confused.
I know all about you and what you can do.
I planned this out in excruciating detail long in advance.
\e

// 対武装シエル
WinMes14:
chara_type 106
Quite the feisty one, aren't you?!
Mezzo-Soprano, take her to the torture chamber.
A few days in there should cool her head.
\e

// 対ロア
WinMes15:
chara_type 306
Accursed serpent...
A tarantella would be wasted on you.
Make do with a scherzo instead.
\e

// 対ノエル
WinMes16:
chara_type 303
chara_type_sub 306
chara_switchframe 680
You're not as bad as Ciel, but...
You've got no finesse.
Maybe there's more to you than meets the eye...
(For now, I'll build her up and see what happens.)
\e

// 対死徒ノエル
WinMes17:
chara_type 306
Soprano, Alto. Play us a dirge.
And give her a proper burial.
In spite of it all, I still admire her efforts to do good.
\e

// 対青子
WinMes18:
chara_type 305
Don't go thinking you can get away now!
Mezzo-Soprano, get me Karius!
I'm about to submit the longest
formal complaint he's ever seen!
\e

Phew. I got through it, somehow.
Good thing she was so unstable...
But, I've got what I came for.
Now I just have to wait for Roa to awaken.
\e

That wasn't a bad workout.
Looks like the Piano Machine is in fine condition, too.
Maybe it's time for Mario the Puppeteer to make his comeback.
\e

WinMesArcadeWin15:

Learn your place, Magician!
Aaah, that felt good!
Laurentis brought all this on himself.
But that doesn't mean you can underestimate the rest of us!

Three in a row, huh?
Looks like we're off to a good start.
\e

WinMes10WinStreak00:
chara_type 302
Ten wins! I know talent when I see it!
How'd you like to serve under me? I'll treat you well.
\e
