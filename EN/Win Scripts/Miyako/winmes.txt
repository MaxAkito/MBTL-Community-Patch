Uuuu...
Hyah!!!
\e


WinMes01:
chara_type 1
Hah! Hyah! Take that! Well?!
Had enough?! With my bajiquan skills,
no second strike is needed!
\e


WinMes02:
chara_type 102
Yay! I did it! Shiki's sure to
compliment me after that!
\e


WinMes03:
chara_type 100
Perfection! I am perfection! This is the
result of my daily Kung Fu training!
\e


WinMes04:
chara_type 2
Don't underestimate me just because I'm a kid! I may
be small now, but just wait a couple years!
\e


WinMes05:
chara_type 104
Hold on, how is it I can change direction in mid-air?
Oh well, probably better not to think about it.
\e


WinMes06:
chara_type 1
Of course I'm strong! There's a dojo connected to
my house after all! It wasn't used
for a long time, but that's a secret.
\e


WinMes07:
chara_type 4
Ouch, my knuckles are throbbing. Looks like
my Kung Fu skills still need work.
\e


WinMes08:
chara_type 101
Take that! In battle, flexibility trumps simple brawn!
Your cheap punches won't work on me!
\e


WinMes09:
chara_type 103
That's enough practice for today. I've got
to go check on the Tohno estate!
\e


WinMes10:
chara_type 1
What a workout. I'm exhausted.
Time to get some sleep.
\e


WinMes11:
chara_type 103
This won't do! It's never honorable to pick on the weak!
As Shiki's sister, I must fight in the name of justice!
\e


WinMes12:
chara_type 3
How strange. Am I getting stronger? Things I couldn't
do yesterday seem almost easy today. Oh, I know!
I must be in the middle of a growth spurt!
\e

chara_type 2
Y-You think just because you have better-looking hair
that I'd be jealous? You're just an impostor!
\e

WinMes14:
chara_type 104
Shiki! Now that I have your attention, would you
help me with my homework?!
\e

For someone who fights with such ferociousness,
you sure are super polite about it.
What? My brother is this way?
Thanks, Mr. Monk!

Xiexie. I learned a lot from that, Mother!
Whoops! Wait! Sister!
I meant Sister!

WinMes3WinStreak00:
chara_type 102
All right! Three wins in a row just proves
without a doubt that I've grown strong!
\e


WinMes10WinStreak00:
chara_type 0
Wow! Ten whole wins! This must mean
I'm already a martial arts master!
I'm a little afraid of myself...
