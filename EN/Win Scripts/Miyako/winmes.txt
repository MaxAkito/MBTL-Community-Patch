chara_type 1
Hah! Hyah! Take that! Well?!
Had enough?!
Bajiquan needs no second strike!
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 102
Yay! I did it!
Shiki's sure to compliment me after that!
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 100
I'm in form! Perfect form!
This is all thanks to my daily kung fu training!
\e

WinMes04:
chara_type 2
Don't underestimate me just because I'm a kid! 
I may be small now, but I'll grow up in no time!
\e

WinMes05:
chara_type 104
Hold on, how is it I can dash in mid-air? Hmm... 
well whatever, probably best not to think about it.
\e

WinMes06:
chara_type 1
Of course I'm strong! 
I've got a dojo at home after all! 
I'll just keep it a secret that nobody ever used it...
\e

WinMes07:
chara_type 4
Ouchie, clenching my fists hurts. 
Looks like my kung fu skills still need work...
\e

WinMes08:
chara_type 101
The sword is mightier than the pen!
Ha-haa, I don't feel your teensy-weensy punches at all! 
\e

WinMes09:
chara_type 103
That's enough practice for today. 
Now time to go monitor the Tohno estate!
\e

WinMes10:
chara_type 1
What a workout. I'm exhausted.
Time to get some sleep.
\e

WinMes11:
chara_type 103
Stop that! 
Don't you know bullying people weaker than you is bad?
I'm Shiki's sister, a hero who fights for justice. Watch out!
\e

WinMes12:
chara_type 3
How strange. Are my stances getting stronger?
Things I couldn't do yesterday seem almost easy today. 
Oh, I get it! This is that growth spurt thing I've heard about!

All right! Winning three straight times that's like...

Wow! Ten whole wins!
Doesn't this mean I'm basically a martial artist master...
My future potential scares even myself...
