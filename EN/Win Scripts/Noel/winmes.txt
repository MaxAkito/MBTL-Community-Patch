Eeek! ☆ That was a really close one!
I was so scared!
There, that should be good for those degenerates
in the church I work with. And...send.

chara_type 2
You didn't think I'd let you off the hook, did you?
Finding a heathen worthy of pity is harder than
finding marriage material at a speed-dating event.
\e


WinMes02:
chara_type 5
What? You expected me to go easy on you? Why would I
do that when I can barely hold my own out here?
Are you an idiot?
\e


WinMes03:
chara_type 100
All losers get processed exactly the same. Though I suppose
if you've got a nice face, I might be able to show a
teensy bit of favoritism.
\e


WinMes04:
chara_type 100
You know an executor of the church stronger than me?
Is that so? Very well, then. I'll just have to show you
exactly what makes me better than them.

chara_type 0
Holy Father, Your will shall be done.
Such a convenient little phrase, don't you think?

WinMes06:
chara_type 101
What should I do on my day off tomorrow? I don't have the
energy for speed dating or another self-improvement class.
\e


WinMes07:
chara_type 104
Somehow I managed to survive another night.
I'm just an average person. How long
can I keep this up?

What? No way! I've been had?! Have you got the flu
or something, Ciel?!

chara_type 103
You think you're so special, don't you? Well if you're so
much better than us humans, then maybe you should find
someone who isn't human to fight.
\e


// 対ノエル

chara_type 5
What was that? A phantom of m--?
Come on Noel, pull yourself together.
You're still just a regular human.

chara_type 6
Now's my chance! Time to retreat!
Phew... I think I managed to lose her.
What was with that girl's specs, anyway? Invisible attacks?
It's almost like the rumors of the True Ancestors...
\e

All right! I managed to drive him into a corner! I may
actually be able to pull this off. No, I'm sure I can pull
this off! I just need to trap him in the church, then--
What?! He decides to get serious now?!
