Eeek! ☆ That was a really close one!
I was sooo scared!
There... Those were some good photos!
Now to send these to the Presbyters sicko enough to like 'em.

You didn't think I'd let you go so easily, did you?
Finding a heathen worthy of pity is harder than
finding marriage material at a speed-dating event.
\e

chara_type 5
What? You expected me to go easy on you? Why would I
do that when I can barely hold my own out here?
Are you stupid?

All losers get processed exactly the same. Though I suppose
if you've got a nice face, I might be able to show a
teensy bit of favoritism.

You know an Executor stronger than me?
Sure, whatever. Guess I'll just have to slowly and

I managed to make it through this night as well...
I'm just an ordinary person...

There you go, thinking you're some kind of otherwordly being.
Well if you think you're sooo much better than us humans, 
then maybe you should go fight someone who isn't.

What was that? Some kind of phantom Noel...?
Come on Noel, pull yourself together...
You're still just a regular human...

Now's my chance! Retreeeaaat!
Phew... I think I managed to lose her.
That girl's abilities are no joke. Invisible attacks?
It's like those True Ancestors I've heard of...

All right! I'm winning somehow! 
I may actually be able to pull this off. No, I'm sure I can pull

What?! No way! NOW he decides to get serious?!
