Eeek! ☆ That was a really close one!
I was sooo scared!
There, that should be good for those degenerates
in the church I work with. And... send.

You didn't think I'd let you off the hook, did you?
Finding a heathen worthy of pity is harder than
finding marriage material at a speed-dating event.
\e

chara_type 5
What? You expected me to go easy on you? Why would I
do that when I can barely hold my own out here?
Are you an idiot?

All losers get processed exactly the same. Though I suppose
if you've got a nice face, I might be able to show a
teensy bit of favoritism.

You know an Executor stronger than me?
Is that so? Very well, then. Suppose I'll have to slowly and

I managed to make it through this night as well...
I'm just an average person...  
Just how long can I keep this up?

Don't act like you're such a transcendental being.
Well if you're so much better than us humans, 
then maybe you should go fight someone who isn't.

What was that? A phantom of me--?
Come on Noel, pull yourself together.
You're still just a regular human.

Now's my chance! Time to retreat!
Phew... I think I managed to lose her.
What was with that girl's specs, anyway? Invisible attacks?
It's like those True Ancestors I've heard of...

All right! I managed to drive him into a corner! I may

What?! NOW he decides to get serious?!
