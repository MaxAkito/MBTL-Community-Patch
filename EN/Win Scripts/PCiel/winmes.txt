WinMes00:
chara_type 3
Elimination complete.
Transitioning all armaments to ground state. Proceeding to next mission.
\e

WinMes01:
chara_type 3
Usually, I like to rely on technique and experience.
But with these armaments, I can just power through.
You're not enough to stop me.
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 0
You've been completely outclassed. Pathetic.
My physical power has been strengthened using magecraft. 
I have to, since I'm handling these heavy weapons with my feminine body.
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 1
You should be honored.
This mallet is a horn of purity, which has endured for millenia.
Under normal circumstances, I would never use it on the likes of you.
\e

WinMes04:
chara_type 1
chara_type_sub 3
chara_switchframe 450
Blaze, Blade, Break.
These three are currently my primary armaments.
Were they to your liking?
\e

WinMes05:
chara_type 203
My magic circuits are on a different level to yours.
It's like comparing the engines of a motorcycle to
a rocket's. Did you really think you stood a chance?
\e

// 対アルクェイド
WinMes06:
chara_type 3
You underestimated MY state of excitation, Arcueid.
I managed to gouge out your heart faster than you were
able to reach your full potential power.
\e

// 対志貴
WinMes07:
chara_type 104
chara_type_sub 102
chara_switchframe 490
Your intentions may be good,
but you're a part of this now.
I'd recommend laying low for a few nights.
You got that?
\e

// 対秋葉
WinMes08:

chara_switchframe 600
Obviously I ought to eliminate you here and now, but...
I'll choose to believe in your humanity. Or rather, your self-dignity. 
Because... In that aspect, above all else,
you're the strongest person I know, Akiha.
\e

//対暴走アルクェイド
WinMes09:
chara_type 1
Now that was a battle of pure power versus power.
That said, you've yet to show your true nature,
just as I've yet to deploy the entirety of the Seventh Holy Scripture.
We'll see which one of us is strongest when that times comes.
\e

//対マーリオゥ
WinMes10:
chara_type 203
Creatura's Piano Machine...
To think the esteemed Acting Presbyter
would be wielding such an old-fashioned weapon.
\e

//対ノエル

chara_switchframe 600
It appears you're at least keeping yourself at the minimum standard
befitting of an Executor. Actually, you've gotten a bit sharper lately.
Did you perhaps discover some source of motivation to improve, 
Sister Noel?
\e

//対死徒ノエル
WinMes12:
chara_type 1
Might makes right.
Dead Apostle Noel...
Your weakness, has come to judgment.
\e

// 対ロア
WinMes13:
chara_type 1
This is the end, Serpent of Akasha.
I've shattered your soul with the Seventh Holy Scripture.
All that your twisted beliefs have led to are the depths of darkness.
\e

// 対吸血鬼
WinMes14:
chara_type 203
I have no sympathy or understanding to spare for inhuman creatures such as you.
Your death will amount to no more than a single line of text in my report.
\e

// 対青子

So that was the Fifth Magician...
She and I are kind of alike, yet also complete opposites.
I boast an unprecedented magical energy production amount,
while she boasts an anomalous acceleration amount. Something like that.
\e

chara_type 203
Excuse me, but I have to hurry.
I'll leave your wounds to the Executors you have with you.
That said, I am grateful for the advice.

Three straight wins. Not that its anything special.
It's true that I'm in good condition though. 
\e

WinMes10WinStreak00:

Ten consecutive wins... I see, ten whole wins... Hehe.
I think I'm worthy of being called a champion, don't you?
\e
