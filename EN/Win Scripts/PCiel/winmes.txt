WinMes00:
chara_type 3
Elimination complete.
Shifting armaments to ground state. Proceeding to next target.
\e

WinMes01:
chara_type 3
Usually, I like to rely on technique and experience.
But now, I can just power through.
You were no match for me!
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 0
If that's all you've got, you never stood a chance.
My body's been magically augmented.
I wouldn't be able to wield these weapons otherwise.
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 1
You should be honored.
My mallet is made from the horn of a unicorn, a symbol
of thousands of years of purity.
It's too good for the likes of you.
\e

WinMes04:

chara_switchframe 450
Blaze, Blade, Break.
These three make up my core arms.
How did do you like them?
\e

WinMes05:
chara_type 203
My Magic Circuits are on a different level to yours.
It's like comparing the engines of a motorcycle to
a rocket's. You don't stand a chance.
\e

// 対アルクェイド
WinMes06:
chara_type 3
You underestimated your opponent, Arcueid.
If you'd powered up any more, I might have been in trouble.
But I was quicker on the draw. This is the end.
\e

// 対志貴
WinMes07:
chara_type 104
chara_type_sub 102
chara_switchframe 490
Whatever your original intentions,
you're a part of this now.
I'd recommend laying low for a few nights.
What do you say?
\e

// 対秋葉
WinMes08:

I ought to eliminate you here and now, but...
I believe in your humanity. Or rather, your self-respect.
Because... In that aspect, above all else,
you're the strongest person I know, Akiha.
\e

//対暴走アルクェイド
WinMes09:
chara_type 1
Now that was a battle of pure power versus power.
You need to learn to control your true nature,
and I need to become more worthy of the agency.
Looks like we both have a ways to go until we can settle things.
\e

//対マーリオゥ
WinMes10:
chara_type 203
Creatura's Piano Machine...
You're the last person I expected to see
wielding an ancient weapon like that.
\e

//対ノエル
WinMes11:
chara_type 1

chara_switchframe 600
Looks like you still have some awareness of your duty.
And your skills have improved somewhat, too.
What happened to get you so motivated all of a sudden,
Sister Noel?
\e

//対死徒ノエル
WinMes12:
chara_type 1
Conviction without the power to back it up is meaningless.
Dead Apostle Noel...
May you suffer for your sins, and your lack of strength.
\e

// 対ロア
WinMes13:
chara_type 1
I'm putting an end to you, Serpent of Akasha.
Your tainted soul is no match for the Seventh Holy Scripture.
All your heretical ideals have earned you is eternal darkness.
\e

// 対吸血鬼
WinMes14:
chara_type 203
Inhuman creatures like you deserve no sympathy.
Your death will be nothing more than another notch on my belt.
\e

// 対青子

So that was the Fifth Magician...
She and I are kind of alike...but also complete opposites.
Between her speed and my regenerative power,
I wonder who is more exceptional?
\e

Sorry, but I'm in a hurry.
The Executors can treat your wounds.
Thank you for the advice, though.
\e

Three victories for me. Well, it's only natural.
This is nothing worth celebrating just yet.
\e

Ten consecutive wins... Heehee. I like that.
I think I'm worthy of being called a champion, don't you?
\e
