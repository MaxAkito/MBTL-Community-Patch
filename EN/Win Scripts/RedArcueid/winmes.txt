You done? 
Then you can consider your life done as well.

That was so boring. Though I did find that last
look of pain on your face a little bit exciting.
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 102
Oh, I'm sorry. The difference in scale between us was just too much.
Harmful as you may be, you're nothing but an insect regardless.
I'm gonna have to be a bit more careful next time. Well, if there is one.
\e

That was anti-climactic. 
You mortals really are just sooo fragile. 
Aren't there any of you that can take more of a beating?
\e

WinMes04:
chara_type 100
Hehe. So much jumping and bouncing around. 
I just love fighting with my own hands and feet.
It's like a nice game of hacky sack.

Boooring. I'm finally free to do as I please, but now
there's not a single person who can keep up with me.
Hehe... This poses quite the problem.
Who knows what'll happen if I can't take out my frustrations?
\e

If one is to rule, be gentle as a maiden.
If one is to control, be firm like a queen.
I AM royalty--that's the least that can be expected of me.

WinMes07:
chara_type 102
This body is just about at its limit.
Hahhh...
Isn't there anyone who could maybe kill me again?
\e

WinMes08:
chara_type 2
Don't bother trying to overpower me.
But well, If you really wish to kill me, 
try sneaking up on me like he once did.

Was that perhaps... a new me?
I see... Compact and bunched up...
I see, I see...

WinMes10:
chara_type 1
Gotcha~ Now it's your turn, little wolf.
I'll have you take responsibility for killing me...
Until that soul of yours has been completely spent.
\e

// 対シエル
WinMes11:
chara_type 102
Wait, you're done already, Ciel? But... coming back to life 
after you're killed is the only thing you're good for!
