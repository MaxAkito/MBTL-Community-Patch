Is that all you've got? Then I will go ahead
and put you out of your misery.

What a waste of time. Though that last look
of pain on your face was kind of exciting.

You'll have to excuse me. Our powers are just too different.
It’s difficult for me to fight a bug without accidentally
crushing it. I'll try to be more careful next time.
\e

Well that was disappointing. You mortals really are
pathetic, aren't you? Isn't there one of you that can
take more of a beating without breaking?
\e


WinMes04:
chara_type 100
Hehehe. So much bouncing around. I just love
fighting with my own hands and feet.
It's like a nice game of hacky sack.

This is no fun at all. I'm finally free to do as I please,
and there's no one around to have fun with.
I'm going to need another playmate to take out some of
my frustration on before it gets the better of me.

If one is to rule, be gentle as a young lady. If one is
to govern, be firm like a queen. You are unfit to call
yourself royalty without knowing at least this much.

WinMes07:
chara_type 102
This body is just about at its limit.
How disappointing. Isn't there
anyone who can kill me again?
\e


WinMes08:
chara_type 2
Don't bother challenging me head on.
If you really wish to kill me, you'll have
to sneak up on me from behind.

What was that? A new version of myself?
I see. Everything wrapped up in a nice
little package. How quaint.

I have you now. Now it's your turn, little wolf.
I'll have you take responsibility for killing me.
I'll make sure your very spirit is shattered.

WinMes11:

Done already, Ciel? I suppose your only redeeming
quality is the fact that you don't die when killed.

This is all due to the fact you're using me.
But you can do much better.

to relieve stress, so thanks!
