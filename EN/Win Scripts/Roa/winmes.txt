For a nobody, you're not half bad. Any circus would be glad
to have someone with a face and moves like yours. In fact,
if you don't bleed out, that's probably what you should do.

That left me a bit hungry. You wouldn't mind if I took a
little donation of blood, would you? I suffer from a
chronic case of anemia, as you might be able to tell.
\e

WinMes02:

One charred corpse coming up! Now all that's left
is to let the strays in the back-alleys have some fun with it!
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 1
Is it over already? That was no fun at all. A battle is
something you should take slowly, allowing you to savor
your opponent's pain, wouldn't you-- Oh, excuse me.
I didn't realize you'd already stopped breathing.
\e

As thanks for allowing me to enjoy myself, I'll do the humane
thing and bury you... Rejoice! Not many people have ever had the honor 
of experiencing the hellish sensation of being cremated by lightning.
\e

WinMes05:

Sorry about that. It took longer than I expected. I would
have liked to send your head rolling with a single attack,
but that actually requires more techqniue than you'd think. 
Sure makes you respect the samurai of old, doesn't it?
\e

WinMes06:

Stop moving around, will you? Your blood's gonna spill
and I don't feel like drinking off the ground today.
I have to act like a proper vampire at least once in a while.

What you and I see aren't the same, you say? 
Hah, but they are! At the end of the day,
all they do is cut things to pieces!
\e

// 対アルクェイド

So even a True Ancestor can malfunction, huh? 
Just a single scratch, and your worth has fallen this much.
Right, that must be the sole flaw of a perfect being.
\e

You know you're completely wasting your potential, Sister?
I could've put it to much better use than you...
It really is a damn shame to put an end to someone with
so much talent! Truly a waste!
\e

// 対秋葉
WinMes10:

Hmm...? The sensations in my body do dampen somewhat
when I'm up against this one.
Perhaps it's because of love, perhaps because of lust...
I can't really tell either way.
\e

What an awful night this is, wouldn't you agree, my fellow vampire? 
I get a bit depressed... Even the moonlight is too bright for me.

What a shame. Looks like nothing has changed.
I was hoping that at least you would've been able to
cut me apart, alongside this deviation of events...

Those excessive weapons are nothing but a shackle for you.
You've practically put your miraculous body into bondage. 
The bondage of human knowledge. Before you go cursing other 
heresies, you'd best come to terms with your own otherwordliness first.

Splendid. I see there will be no lack of
blood to drink with you around.

Hey, you're pretty good! If things were different,
I would've made you my underling!
