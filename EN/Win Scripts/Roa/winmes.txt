For a nobody, you're not half bad. With moves and a face
like yours, any circus would be glad to have you. In fact,
if you don't bleed out, that's probably what you should do.
\e

That left me a bit hungry. You wouldn't mind if I took a
little donation of blood, would you? I suffer from a
chronic case of anemia, you see.
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 2
One charred corpse coming up! Now all that's left
is to let the strays in the back-alleys have some fun with it!
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 1
Is it over already? That was no fun at all. A battle is
something you should take slowly, allowing you to savor
in your opponent's pain, wouldn't you-- Oh, never mind.
I didn't realize you'd already stopped breathing.
\e

WinMes04:

As thanks for allowing me to enjoy myself, I shall give you
a proper human burial. At any rate, be grateful you do 
not have to experience the hell of being cremated by lightning.
\e

WinMes05:
chara_type 2
Sorry about that. It took longer than I expected. I would
have liked to send your head rolling with a single attack,
but that's actually a lot harder than you'd think. Sure
makes you respect the samurai of old, doesn't it?
\e

WinMes06:
chara_type 0
Try not to move so much, would you? You'll only bleed out
faster, and I don't feel like drinking off the ground today.
I have to act like a proper vampire at least once in a while.

What you and I see aren't the same, you say? 
Hah, but they are! At the end of the day,
things end up being cut to bits all the same.
\e

// 対アルクェイド
WinMes08:

So even a True Ancestor can malfunction, huh? 
To think how much your worth would fall by just a single scratch.
Right, that must be sole flaw of a perfect being.
\e

// 対シエル
WinMes09:

A complete waste of your precious potential, Sister.
I could've put it to much better use than you...
It really is a damn shame to put an end to one with
such talent! Truly a waste!
\e

// 対秋葉
WinMes10:
chara_type 1
Hmm... the sensations in my body does dampen somewhat
when I'm up against this one.
Perhaps it is because of love, perhaps because of lust...
I can't really tell either way.
\e

// 対暴走アルク

What an awful night this is, wouldn't you agree, my fellow vampire? 
I get a bit depressed... even the moonlight is too bright for me.

What a shame. Looks like nothing has changed.
I was hoping you of all peoplea at least would 
capable of dissecting me alongside this deviation...

For you, those excessive weapons are but a shackle.
It's like you've bound that miraculous body of yours
with the knowledge of man. Before you go cursing other's heresies,
you'd best come to terms with your own otherwordlyness first.

Splendid. I see there will be no lack of
blood to drink with you around.

Not bad! If things were different,
I would have made you my underling!
