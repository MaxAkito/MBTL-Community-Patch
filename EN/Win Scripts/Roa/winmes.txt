For a nobody, you're not half bad. With moves and a face
like yours, any circus would be glad to have you. In fact,
if you don't bleed out, that's probably what you should do.

That left me a bit hungry. You wouldn't mind if I took a
little donation of blood, would you? I suffer from a
chronic case of anemia, you see.
\e


WinMes02:
chara_type 2
Order up! Who wanted the charred corpse?! There are plenty
more strays in the back alley where this one came from!
\e


WinMes03:
chara_type 1
Is it over already? That was no fun at all. A battle is
something you should take slowly, allowing you to savor
in your opponent's pain, wouldn't you-- Oh, never mind.
I didn't realize you'd already stopped breathing.
\e

As thanks for allowing me to enjoy myself, I shall give you
a proper human burial. Be grateful you do not have to
experience burial by fire or lightning.
\e

Sorry about that. It took longer than I expected. I would
have liked to send your head rolling with a single attack,
but that's actually a lot harder than you'd think. Sure
makes you respect the samurai of old, doesn't it?
\e


WinMes06:

Try not to move so much, would you? You'll only bleed out
faster, and I don't feel like drinking off the ground today.
I have to act like a proper vampire at least once in a while.

Still trying to say we're different? You and I
are the same! Just look! Everything we
touch ends up in pieces!
\e

WinMes08:

So even a True Ancestor can break down, huh? I still can't
believe how far your worth drops with a single wound.
Must be the one fatal flaw of the perfect being.
\e


// 対シエル
WinMes09:

What a pity. And here you had such potential, Sister.
If only you had worked for me, I could have put you to
much better use than this. It really is a shame to put
an end to one with such talent! Truly a waste!
\e


// 対秋葉
WinMes10:
chara_type 1
Fighting one-on-one like this always
makes me feel tingly all over.
I still can't figure out if it's
love or lust, though.
\e


// 対暴走アルク

What an awful night this is, wouldn't you agree? I always
get depressed when the moon is so bright.

What a shame. Looks like nothing has changed.
I was hoping you of all people would be
capable of dismantling this mutation...

Those weapons of yours are more of a hindrance than a help.
Your body is a miraculous gift, yet its potential is limited
by your feeble human understanding. Instead of viewing it
as a heresy, you should embrace it.

Splendid. I see there will be no lack of
blood to drink with you around.

Not bad! If things were different,
I would have made you work for me!
