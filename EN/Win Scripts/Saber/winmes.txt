Dead Apostle... Not a word you'd often hear in the land I am from.
If they are weak to sunlight, perhaps I should have

This must be fate of some kind.

There do not seem to be any other Servants here.
Hopefully I'm not too out of place..

This city does not seem to slumber. I have heard tales of
late-night restaurants that serve delicious meals. Would you
be so kind as to point me in the right direction? Perhaps

You two have such excellent teamwork, I mistook you for
a pair of highly skilled Assassins. I did not expect to learn
you are simply mischievous maids. There's certainly
something strange about the noble class in this town.
