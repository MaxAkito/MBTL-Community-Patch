I do not require a guide. 
I am familiar with this country's cities, after all. 
That said, this city is far more urban than the one I know.

Dead Apostle... 
Not a word you'd often hear in the land I am from.
Perhaps I should have borrowed Sir Gawain's blade
since they're so weak to sunlight.

This must be fate of some kind.
I could lend you my strength should it prove necessary.

There do not seem to be any other Servants here.
Hopefully I'm not too out of place...

This city does not seem to slumber. 
I have heard tales of late-night restaurants 
that serve delicious meals. Would you be so kind 
as to point me in the right direction? 
Perhaps even recommend one such establishment?

Phew... 
It would seem I was able to end this without injuring you. 
I've got to be careful to not stand out as much next time.

You might be my enemy, but I must say you possess some 
astonishing powers. You might come out on top next time.

Return to dust, monster.
Whatever form it may take,
I shall strike any evil which would threaten humanity.

You two have such excellent teamwork, I mistook you for
a pair of highly skilled Assassins. I did not expect to learn
you are simply a pair of mischievous maids. There's certainly
something strange about the nobility in this city.
