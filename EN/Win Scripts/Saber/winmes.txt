I do not require a guide. 
I know Japanese cities well, after all. 
That said, this city is far more urban than the one I know.

Dead Apostle... 
Not a word you'd often hear in the land I am from.
Perhaps I should have borrowed Sir Gawain's sword
if they're so weak to sunlight.

This must be fate of some kind.
I could lend you my strength should it prove necessary.

There do not seem to be any other Servants here.
Hopefully I'm not too out of place...

A nightless city without slumber...
Speaking of... I have heard these sorts of urban late-night
dining establishments serve especially delicious food.
May I ask of you to provide me with an exact address and 
recommendation as to what to order?

Phew... 
It would seem I was able to end this without injuring you. 
I've got to be careful to not stand out as much next time.

You might be my enemy, but I must say you possess some 
astonishing powers. You might come out on top next time.

Return to dust, monster.
Whatever form it may take, I shall strike 
down any evil which would threaten the populace.

You two have such excellent teamwork, I mistook you for
a pair of highly skilled Assassins. I did not expect to learn
you are simply a pair of mischievous maids. There's certainly
something strange about the nobility in this city.
