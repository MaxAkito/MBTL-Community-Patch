WinMes00:
chara_type 101
You wanna go again? I'm game,
but you should probably quit
while you still can.
\e


WinMes01:
chara_type 103
Wow, thought I was a goner there for a second. 
I guess that's what I get for going easy on you.
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 1
You're alive, right?
See, all things that are alive eventually die.
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 101
Gotta go. I can only fight for so long before I get anemic.
\e


WinMes04:
chara_type 3
You had fun? Good for you. Personally, I'm totally beat. 
Try to be a bit more considerate next time.
\e

WinMes05:
chara_type 1
Sorry, but I've got places to be. I'll call an ambulance for you.
You can think about what you did in your hospital bed.
\e

WinMes06:
chara_type 101
Black cats, crows, hearses... 
Something about walking under weeping willows too.
It seems bad luck has cursed the both of us.
\e

WinMes07:
chara_type 1
Try harder next time. 
You know how it is these days. Appearances can be deceiving.
Never know what'll turn out to be dangerous.
\e

// 対アルクェイド
WinMes08:
chara_type 103
Whoa! That was dangerous! You just don't know
how to hold back, do you, Arcueid?
So don't go picking fights just because
you feel like it.
\e

// 対シエル
WinMes09:
chara_type 100
Thanks, Ciel. 
I really love the way you 
always hold back against me.
\e

// 対秋葉
WinMes10:
chara_type 103
That was terrifying... 
Has Akiha been training in secret or something?
\e

// 対ヒスコハ
WinMes11:
chara_type 101
Sorry, you two! I promise to head back to the mansion when
I'm finished! I'll make this up to you then!
\e

// 対翡翠
WinMes12:
chara_type 101
I didn't realize there was an imitation Hisui out there.
Still, it doesn’t feel right raising a hand against her. 
Sorry about that.
\e

// 対琥珀
WinMes13:
chara_type 103
You're just an imitation of Kohaku, aren't you? I'll have
to remember to apologize to the real one when I see her.
Do you mind if we call it a day?
\e

// 対軋間
WinMes14:
chara_type 1
Who... was that...?
I can't remember...
It almost felt as if I was dreaming of the past...
\e

Three wins already?! I had planned on going home early,
but would you mind me sticking around for a bit longer?
\e

chara_type 0
Ten wins?! That's amazing!
This is getting pretty fun!
Let's keep it up!
