WinMes00:
chara_type 101
You want to go again? I'm game,
but you should probably quit
while you still can.
\e


WinMes01:
chara_type 103
Wow, thought I was a goner there for a second. I guess
that's what I get for going easy on you.
\e


WinMes02:
chara_type 1
Still alive? Be careful. Everything has to die
eventually, you know.
\e


WinMes03:
chara_type 101
Gotta go. I can only fight for so long before I get anemic.
\e


WinMes04:
chara_type 3
You had fun? I'm glad. Try not to take things so seriously
next time though, will you? I'm exhausted.
\e


WinMes05:
chara_type 1
Sorry, but I've got places to be. I'll call an ambulance
for you if you promise to think about what you did.
\e


WinMes06:
chara_type 101
Black cats, crows, hearses... I remember hearing something
about weeping willows once, too. It would seem you and I
are both cursed with bad luck.
\e


WinMes07:
chara_type 1
Try harder next time. Appearances can be
deceiving. You never know who is going to
grow up to be powerful.
\e


// 対アルクェイド
WinMes08:
chara_type 103
Woah! That was dangerous! You just don't know
how to hold back, do you Arcueid? There is
such a thing as a friendly match
between allies, you know?
\e


// 対シエル
WinMes09:
chara_type 100
Thanks, Ciel. I think it's sweet
when you decide to
hold back like that.
\e


// 対秋葉
WinMes10:
chara_type 103
What was that? Has Akiha been training
in secret or something?
\e


// 対ヒスコハ
WinMes11:
chara_type 101
Sorry, you two! I promise to head back to the house when
I'm finished! I'll make this up to you then!
\e


// 対翡翠
WinMes12:
chara_type 101
I didn't realize there was an imitation Hisui out there.
Still, it doesn’t feel right raising a hand against
her. Sorry about that.
\e


// 対琥珀
WinMes13:
chara_type 103
You're just an imitation of Kohaku, aren't you? I'll have
to remember to apologize to the real one when I see her.
Do you mind if we call it a day?
\e


// 対軋間
WinMes14:
chara_type 1
Who...was that...? I can't quite place him,
but I feel like I've seen him in a dream
long ago or something...
\e

Three wins already?! I had planned on going home early,
but would you mind sticking around for a bit longer?

Ten wins?! That's amazing!
This is getting interesting!
Let's keep it up!
