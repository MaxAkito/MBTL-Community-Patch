WinMes00:
chara_type 101
You want to go again? I'm game,
but you should probably quit
while you still can.
\e


WinMes01:
chara_type 103
Wow, thought I was a goner there for a second. I guess
that's what I get for going easy on you.
\e

WinMes02:
chara_type 1
You're alive, right?
Because, all things that are alive die.
\e

WinMes03:
chara_type 101
Gotta go. I can only fight for so long before I get anemic.
\e


WinMes04:
chara_type 3
You had fun? Good for you. Personally I'm totally beat. 
Try to be a bit more considerate next time.
\e

WinMes05:
chara_type 1
Sorry, but I've got places to be. I'll call an ambulance
for you if you promise to think about what you did.
\e

WinMes06:
chara_type 101
Black cats, crows, hearses... I remember hearing something
about weeping willows once, too. It would seem you and I
are both cursed with bad luck.
\e

WinMes07:
chara_type 1
Try harder next time. 
With things as they are, you never know what'll turn
out to be dangerous. Appearances can be deceiving.
\e

// 対アルクェイド
WinMes08:
chara_type 103
Woah! That was dangerous! You just don't know
how to hold back, do you Arcueid?
So don't go picking fights just because
you feel like it.
\e

// 対シエル
WinMes09:
chara_type 100
Thanks, Ciel. I think it's sweet
when you decide to
hold back like that.
\e

// 対秋葉
WinMes10:
chara_type 103
What was that? Has Akiha been training
in secret or something?
\e

// 対ヒスコハ
WinMes11:
chara_type 101
Sorry, you two! I promise to head back to the house when
I'm finished! I'll make this up to you then!
\e

// 対翡翠
WinMes12:
chara_type 101
I didn't realize there was an imitation Hisui out there.
Still, it doesn’t feel right raising a hand against
her. Sorry about that.
\e

// 対琥珀
WinMes13:
chara_type 103
You're just an imitation of Kohaku, aren't you? I'll have
to remember to apologize to the real one when I see her.
Do you mind if we call it a day?
\e

// 対軋間
WinMes14:
chara_type 1
Who... was that...?
I can't remember...
It almost felt like I saw a dream from my past...
\e

Three wins already?! I had planned on going home early,
but would you mind sticking around for a bit longer?
\e

Ten wins?! That's amazing!
This is getting interesting!
Let's keep it up!
