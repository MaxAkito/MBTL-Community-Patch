battlevoice_chr000_100,I hope this proves at least something of a fight.,
battlevoice_chr000_101,I don't wanna look at you.,
battlevoice_chr000_102,"Sure, I'll take you on.",
battlevoice_chr000_103,Hm... This could be fun.,
battlevoice_chr000_104,Are you joking? Come back in a hundred years.,
battlevoice_chr000_105,I'll have you take responsibility for killing me.,
battlevoice_chr000_106,Okay! I'll take you on for a bit!,
battlevoice_chr000_107,No way! I'd never lose my temper like that!,
battlevoice_chr000_108,I don't have time to dally around.,
battlevoice_chr000_109,I gotta look out for myself? No problem!,
battlevoice_chr000_650,"You've got guts, I'll give you that.",
battlevoice_chr000_651,"Alright, how about we play around for real?",
battlevoice_chr000_652,Maybe I should be a little serious?,
battlevoice_chr000_653,You're gonna fight me with that equipment? Looking down on me?,
battlevoice_chr000_630,Really think this is even gonna be a fight?,
battlevoice_chr000_631,"Yet again, your body lacks class.",
battlevoice_chr000_632,You've become too ingrained into this land.,
battlevoice_chr000_110,"Alright, it's on!",
battlevoice_chr000_111,Don't say I didn't warn you!,
battlevoice_chr000_112,Seems I won't have to hold back...,
battlevoice_chr000_120,Let's keep going!,
battlevoice_chr000_121,You want to try that again?,
battlevoice_chr000_122,I expected better.,
battlevoice_chr000_637,I expected better.,
battlevoice_chr000_123,Still wanna go?,
battlevoice_chr000_663,Still wanna go?,
battlevoice_chr000_124,"Yeah, that was fun, Shiki!",
battlevoice_chr000_125,Get up. I've not had enough yet.,
battlevoice_chr000_620,Oh? Are you feeling bad?,
battlevoice_chr000_660,Get up already. I'm sick of waiting.,
battlevoice_chr000_661,"Just a little more, I think.",
battlevoice_chr000_662,"Too slow. You did gain weight, didn't you?",
battlevoice_chr000_635,Playing dead? It suits you.,
battlevoice_chr000_636,You still wanna keep up your pathetic struggle?,
battlevoice_chr000_638,"Oh, you're still alive? Well then.",
battlevoice_chr000_130,"Oh, you sure were weak.",
battlevoice_chr000_621,"Oh, you sure were weak.",

battlevoice_chr000_134,This is the end.,
battlevoice_chr000_135,"Whoops, seems the match's over! Åô",
battlevoice_chr000_136,"Oops, maybe I went a bit overboard.",
battlevoice_chr000_622,"Feel sorry yet, Shiki?",
battlevoice_chr000_623,"Phew, It wasn't easy catching you.",
battlevoice_chr000_624,Sorry! I was really feeling it!,
battlevoice_chr000_665,"Wait, we're already done?",
battlevoice_chr000_666,Are you on a diet or something?,
battlevoice_chr000_668,"That was so fun! Nicely done, Ciel!",
battlevoice_chr000_669,"How frail... Wait, you must be an imposter then!",
battlevoice_chr000_640,"Once a snake, always a snake.",
battlevoice_chr000_150,What?! No fair!,
battlevoice_chr000_151,"Fine, whatever.",
battlevoice_chr001_100,Excuse me.,
battlevoice_chr001_810,Excuse me.,
battlevoice_chr001_101,Could I be of service?,
battlevoice_chr001_102,You ought to return home at once.,
battlevoice_chr001_103,I shall begin cleaning.,
battlevoice_chr001_104,"If you wish to have something to eat, perhaps I could offer you this plum sandwich.",
battlevoice_chr001_105,"Master Shiki, it is past your bedtime.",
battlevoice_chr001_106,"K-Kohaku, h-here I come!",
battlevoice_chr001_107,"I have a tight schedule. Please make it brief.",
battlevoice_chr001_108,Quite the unusual event this is.,
battlevoice_chr001_811,"You asked for me, Lady Akiha?",
battlevoice_chr001_812,An evaluation for a possible raise? Understood.,
battlevoice_chr001_813,"Of course, allow me to display my cleaning techniques.",
battlevoice_chr001_110,I will give it my all.,
battlevoice_chr001_111,Time to turn this around.,
battlevoice_chr001_112,Please excuse my rudeness.,
battlevoice_chr001_120,My apologies.,
battlevoice_chr001_800,My apologies.,
battlevoice_chr001_121,Has my work been to your satisfaction?,

battlevoice_chr001_122,Please rest well.,
battlevoice_chr001_123,A-Are you injured?,
battlevoice_chr001_803,A-Are you injured?,
battlevoice_chr001_802,"Please rest well, Master Shiki.",
battlevoice_chr001_814,Leave the security to me.,
battlevoice_chr001_815,Wait... Kohaku... did you...?,
battlevoice_chr001_130,You will all be the culprit.,
battlevoice_chr001_131,Did I win...?,
battlevoice_chr001_132,Humiliation in crushing defeat.,
battlevoice_chr001_133,I-I'm terribly sorry!,
battlevoice_chr001_806,I-I'm terribly sorry!,
battlevoice_chr001_134,I-I managed to win somehow...,
battlevoice_chr001_135,I understand you must not have been feeling well.,
battlevoice_chr001_804,This too is part of a servant's job.,
battlevoice_chr001_805,I am pleased that it appears you enjoyed yourself.,
battlevoice_chr001_816,Was that enough to earn your approval?,
battlevoice_chr001_817,I still have much to learn. I must do better.,
battlevoice_chr001_818,"A flawless performance, if I may say so myself.",
battlevoice_chr001_150,It appears time is up.,
battlevoice_chr001_151,Splendidly done.,
battlevoice_chr002_100,Are you ready?,
battlevoice_chr002_101,"Honestly, why must I do this?",
battlevoice_chr002_102,"I am not lenient, so you know.",
battlevoice_chr002_103,"Shall we begin, then?",
battlevoice_chr002_104,"Quite fearless, aren't you?",
battlevoice_chr002_105,.....,
battlevoice_chr002_106,I hope you're prepared for the consequences.,
battlevoice_chr002_107,"Let's keep this brief, shall we?",
battlevoice_chr002_630,"No, that's not what this is about... *sigh*",
battlevoice_chr002_631,"Very well, the family head shall accept your challenge.",
battlevoice_chr002_110,You are quite skilled.,
battlevoice_chr002_111,"No more holding back, then.",
battlevoice_chr002_112,No more mercy.,
battlevoice_chr002_120,Are you injured?,
battlevoice_chr002_121,Was that to your liking?,
battlevoice_chr002_122,Hehe. That got a bit exciting.,
battlevoice_chr002_123,"Oh dear, is that all?",
battlevoice_chr002_620,That's one for me.,
battlevoice_chr002_621,I-I don't think you should be all too hurt...,
battlevoice_chr002_622,I do dabble in this now and then.,
battlevoice_chr002_623,"Please, you're so undisciplined.",
battlevoice_chr002_632,Still unhurt? Good... then let's keep going.,
battlevoice_chr002_633,You're not so bad after all.,
battlevoice_chr002_634,"Oh dear, is that all?",
battlevoice_chr002_130,"Right, I believe I can let you off now.",
battlevoice_chr002_635,"Right, I believe I can let you off now.",
battlevoice_chr002_131,Are you injured?,
battlevoice_chr002_132,Surely you've learned your lesson?,
battlevoice_chr002_637,Surely you've learned your lesson?,
battlevoice_chr002_133,How absurd. You'll have to do better.,
battlevoice_chr002_638,How absurd. You'll have to do better.,
battlevoice_chr002_134,"Hehe, this has been a great way to relieve stress.",
battlevoice_chr002_135,That was about what I expected.,
battlevoice_chr002_624,"We've just gotten started! Better start feeling sorry.",
battlevoice_chr002_625,Have you been convinced?,
battlevoice_chr002_626,"Well, I will give you that you did your best.",
battlevoice_chr002_627,Wha- my brother is so weak...,
battlevoice_chr002_636,I wonder if I went too far...,
battlevoice_chr002_150,I cannot accept this!,
battlevoice_chr002_151,Why you impudent little...!,
battlevoice_chr002_108,Shouldn't you be working?,
battlevoice_chr003_100,You're serious about this.,
battlevoice_chr003_101,"I'd rather not, but it would seem I have no choice.",
battlevoice_chr003_102,Let's keep this short. I don't have much stamina.,
battlevoice_chr003_103,My head aches so...,
battlevoice_chr003_104,You're making your brother worried.,
battlevoice_chr003_105,I'm against domestic violence!,
battlevoice_chr003_106,"A light spar, is it?",
battlevoice_chr003_107,Aren't you saying you just wanna play around?!,
battlevoice_chr003_108,"Isn't that an abuse of power, Ciel?",
battlevoice_chr003_109,You're telling me the whole Sister thing wasn't just a hobby!?,
battlevoice_chr003_113,"Can we take this elsewher- Not gonna listen, huh?",
battlevoice_chr003_114,Looks like we're both outta luck.,
battlevoice_chr003_650,Um... why did it come to this?,
battlevoice_chr003_110,This is only the beginning.,
battlevoice_chr003_111,"Okay, I've got the gist of it.",
battlevoice_chr003_112,This is getting a little out of hand.,
battlevoice_chr003_652,Damn... So tired...,
battlevoice_chr003_121,"Good grief, this is rough.",
battlevoice_chr003_122,"This isn't over yet, is it?",
battlevoice_chr003_123,"You're better than this, aren't you?",
battlevoice_chr003_124,What a nightmare...,
battlevoice_chr003_120,Damn... So tired...,
battlevoice_chr003_653,I can't just use the back side of a double-edged knife.,
battlevoice_chr003_654,"This isn't over yet, is it?!",
battlevoice_chr003_655,"You're still just raring to go, aren't you?",
battlevoice_chr003_130,"Phew, thought I was a goner there for a minute.",
battlevoice_chr003_131,All's well that ends well.,
battlevoice_chr003_657,"Alright, let's leave it at that then.",
battlevoice_chr003_132,I'm legging it! As if I'd stay around for this!,
battlevoice_chr003_658,"Sorry, I've gotta return some videotapes!",
battlevoice_chr003_133,"If you've had enough, then give up already.",
battlevoice_chr003_134,"This is the end. Begone, vampire.",
battlevoice_chr003_135,"No matter how many times I live, it won't be enough for this.",
battlevoice_chr003_136,"Don't force yourself, just stay down.",
battlevoice_chr003_656,I guess you've settled down?,
battlevoice_chr003_659,Whoops. Looks like I win.,
battlevoice_chr003_150,Damn... my chest wound!,
battlevoice_chr003_151,You kept me running after you the whole time... I admit defeat...,
battlevoice_chr004_100,Hehehe. Let's get going!,
battlevoice_chr004_101,The dependable maid makes her appearance!,
battlevoice_chr004_102,What kind of medicine do you prefer?,
battlevoice_chr004_103,Tonight's injection will be a little different!,
battlevoice_chr004_105,"Hehehe. You weren't supposed to see that, Shiki.",
battlevoice_chr004_106,Hehehe! Let's have a fair fight!,
battlevoice_chr004_107,You look rather suspicious! Your judgment has come!,
battlevoice_chr004_780,"Ah, a snap inspection, is it, Lady Akiha?",
battlevoice_chr004_781,I do this to preserve the peace of the Tohno household.,
battlevoice_chr004_782,Have my actions yesterday been discovere--?,
battlevoice_chr004_783,I'm afraid Shiki is not here.,
battlevoice_chr004_110,This is an outrage!,
battlevoice_chr004_111,Looks like I've been backed into a corner.,
battlevoice_chr004_112,Must think positive!,
battlevoice_chr004_120,"'kay, cleaning complete!",
battlevoice_chr004_121,Don't you change that channel! ÅÙ,
battlevoice_chr004_122,Was that to your satisfaction?,
battlevoice_chr004_123,I know how to handle a broom.,
battlevoice_chr004_790,"I am your physician after all, Shiki.",
battlevoice_chr004_791,"Let's not tell Lady Akiha about this, alright?",
battlevoice_chr004_784,What's that? Even the mighty Akiha can stumble?,
battlevoice_chr004_785,It would seem both of us have revealed our true intentions.,
battlevoice_chr004_789,Have you fallen for me all over again?,
battlevoice_chr004_131,What an unexpected outcome! ÅÙ,
battlevoice_chr004_132,"Phew, that was close.",
battlevoice_chr004_776,"Phew, that was close.",
battlevoice_chr004_133,I did it! An overwhelming victory! ÅÙ,
battlevoice_chr004_134,Please be sure to make an appointment next time.,
battlevoice_chr004_135,"No more pranks, 'kay?",
battlevoice_chr004_792,I appears my survelliance is still lacking...,
battlevoice_chr004_793,Hehehe! Right in the palm of my hand!,
battlevoice_chr004_130,Have you fallen for me all over again?,
battlevoice_chr004_786,Heh-heh-heh! The social structure has been overturned!,
battlevoice_chr004_787,I thought I felt real bloodlust there a few times.,
battlevoice_chr004_788,I must have just gotten lucky this time.,
battlevoice_chr004_150,Does that count as forfeiting?,
battlevoice_chr004_151,But I was the more attractive heroine!,
battlevoice_chr005_100,What a waste of your singular life.,
battlevoice_chr005_101,What's this? Are you in need of an early death?,
battlevoice_chr005_102,Very well. I'll make it brief.,
battlevoice_chr005_103,Hm... Looks like this body has its limits.,
battlevoice_chr005_104,I'm a bit tired of all the killing I do...,
battlevoice_chr005_109,"If you're fine with my skin, then take as much as you'd like.",
battlevoice_chr005_105,How wonderful... My seventeenth matrimony!,
battlevoice_chr005_106,"Well now, if only that were true.",
battlevoice_chr005_107,So fresh. I must be lucky tonight.,
battlevoice_chr005_108,"Damn, it's good to be alive.",
battlevoice_chr005_630,"The vessel is reaching its breaking point...? Centuries of love, all for nothing.",
battlevoice_chr005_110,Don't die on me too easily.,
battlevoice_chr005_111,It seems that I have underestimated you...,
battlevoice_chr005_112,Not bad. You might be worth electrocuting after all.,
battlevoice_chr005_120,A body that can move like this ain't half bad!,
battlevoice_chr005_121,"Hah! Give me a little more entertainment, will you?",
battlevoice_chr005_122,I see. So this is all you're capable of.,
battlevoice_chr005_123,Looks like we're both getting warmed up.,
battlevoice_chr005_635,"C'mon, what's the matter? You're so slow.",
battlevoice_chr005_636,This is what happens when you have nothing but strength.,
battlevoice_chr005_637,"Give me a break. Did you get hit a meteor or something?!",
battlevoice_chr005_638,What a great sensation. I could get used to this.,
battlevoice_chr005_130,"You're still in one piece, aren't you? Get up.",
battlevoice_chr005_131,Hmph. May you slumber in hell eternal.,
battlevoice_chr005_132,It would seem you've underestimated me.,
battlevoice_chr005_133,"Hurry up and die, you shit! You're wasting everyone's time!",
battlevoice_chr005_134,"A good fight deserves a good meal. Isn't that normal?",
battlevoice_chr005_135,"Well then, my expectations were not met.",
battlevoice_chr005_645,Seriously?! Funniest shit ever!,
battlevoice_chr005_646,Looks like the vessel has reached its breaking point.,
battlevoice_chr005_647,Thank you for the exquisite disappointment.,
battlevoice_chr005_648,What's even happening?! Am I in top form or what?!,
battlevoice_chr005_150,Great. Another undecided outcome.,
battlevoice_chr005_151,This is why I hate having a time limit!,
battlevoice_chr006_100,You will be crushed.,
battlevoice_chr006_101,Allow me to perform your rites.,
battlevoice_chr006_102,The saha world can be so turbulent.,
battlevoice_chr006_103,Would be great if we could just end this with a laugh.,
battlevoice_chr006_104,"I shall fight you, though your desires won't be granted.",
battlevoice_chr006_105,You simply live as you please. Most enviable.,
battlevoice_chr006_110,Hyaaahhh!,
battlevoice_chr006_111,That was a pitiful display.,
battlevoice_chr006_112,"Now then, what shall we do?",
battlevoice_chr006_120,Next.,
battlevoice_chr006_121,Keep it in moderation.,
battlevoice_chr006_122,You still rise? What an ordeal.,
battlevoice_chr006_123,"Such fighting spirit, practically overflowing.",
battlevoice_chr006_130,You are bereft of grace.,
battlevoice_chr006_131,Do you wish to continue?,
battlevoice_chr006_132,"This has proven a good lesson, my thanks.",
battlevoice_chr006_133,Unsatisfying...,
battlevoice_chr006_135,I must thank you for the workout.,
battlevoice_chr006_136,It's over. Speak your last while you still draw breath.,
battlevoice_chr006_137,I've been made the fool!,
battlevoice_chr006_150,Now the sila cannot be adhered to...,
battlevoice_chr006_151,How far I have fallen...,
battlevoice_chr008_100,Alrighty! Time to get to work!,
battlevoice_chr008_101,Executor Noel makes her grand entrance!,
battlevoice_chr008_102,"Weeell, I think it's time for repentance.",
battlevoice_chr008_103,"Don't expect me to go easy on you, 'kay?",
battlevoice_chr008_104,"Oh no, the teaching job is my hobby \sf000",
battlevoice_chr008_105,I appreciate the lesson! \sf000,
battlevoice_chr008_106,Eeek! As if the True Ancestor wasn't scary enough before!,
battlevoice_chr008_107,Okay! Time to fight!,
battlevoice_chr008_108,"And just what were you staring at, you cheeky little thing Åô",
battlevoice_chr008_110,I'll add your grudge to the list.,
battlevoice_chr008_111,I'm going to snap that little neck of yours.\sf000,
battlevoice_chr008_112,"Oh, come on!",
battlevoice_chr008_120,Wha-? You're still alive? Gross!,
battlevoice_chr008_121,Were you maybe considering something... taboo?,
battlevoice_chr008_122,"Silly me, I might have gone a bit overboard \sf000",
battlevoice_chr008_123,"You're such a softie, that's so cute.",
battlevoice_chr008_124,What's the matter? Out of shape?,
battlevoice_chr008_665,Just how I imagined it!,
battlevoice_chr008_666,"You weren't thinking about Shiki just now, were you?",
battlevoice_chr008_667,"A stronger punch would-- No, nothing!",
battlevoice_chr008_668,At least it's going well so far...,
battlevoice_chr008_130,"Okay, inquisitioning done.",
battlevoice_chr008_131,Just kidding! Did I give you a scare?,
battlevoice_chr008_132,That was real close! What a thankless job I have!,
battlevoice_chr008_133,"I'm sorry, it's just that I'm super strong against weaklings.",
battlevoice_chr008_135,Just kidding! Did I give you a scare?,
battlevoice_chr008_134,Did you enjoy my special lesson?,
battlevoice_chr008_136,Easy-peasy! Awesome! Åô,
battlevoice_chr008_670,"Oh, I get it! This Ciel is a fake!",
battlevoice_chr008_671,What's happening? This went so well it's getting scary.,
battlevoice_chr008_673,"Wow, no way! I won?! Yaaay!",
battlevoice_chr008_675,"Please, could you not so obviously hold back against me?",
battlevoice_chr008_150,Even time is against me!,
battlevoice_chr008_151,"Gooood, I hate working overtime!",
battlevoice_chr009_100,You will make fine kindling for my pyre.,
battlevoice_chr009_101,Who... are you...?,
battlevoice_chr009_102,Don't resist. You're wasting your warmth.,
battlevoice_chr009_103,Introductions are unnessecary...,
battlevoice_chr009_104,Give me your heart...,
battlevoice_chr009_105,I shall kill you by flaying your skin...,
battlevoice_chr009_106,A pupil of the Swordmonk? Where's your Dragon-bone Blade?,
battlevoice_chr009_107,This blood-bag will at least serve well as a bonfire.,
battlevoice_chr009_108,You will fail to make it out alive.,
battlevoice_chr009_110,Driven into a corner...? Splendid.,
battlevoice_chr009_111,"Try not to make my heart flutter, will you?",
battlevoice_chr009_112,"Seems you've gotten the first over me, well then...",
battlevoice_chr009_120,You are overflowing with vitality.,
battlevoice_chr009_121,More. Give me more heat...,
battlevoice_chr009_122,I missed... I grow duller by the day.,
battlevoice_chr009_123,*haah... haah*,
battlevoice_chr009_130,Now this is a hunt.,
battlevoice_chr009_131,"So it's over then. You fought well.",
battlevoice_chr009_132,"I do not feel pain, I only freeze further.",
battlevoice_chr009_133,It would seem I got a bit heated for a moment...,
battlevoice_chr009_134,This is not even funny... What were you doing?,
battlevoice_chr009_135,A thrilling hunt. You will make for fine kindling.,
battlevoice_chr009_150,The sun... has already risen?,
battlevoice_chr009_151,This is unacceptable...,
battlevoice_chr010_100,Humans really are pathetic little things.,
battlevoice_chr010_101,"Will you shame yourself for my enjoyment, I wonder?",
battlevoice_chr010_102,"If don't hurry up and stop me, you'll have a lot of trouble on your hands.",
battlevoice_chr010_103,"Be patient. I'll kill you soon enough.",
battlevoice_chr010_104,"Good evening, my lovely little murderer.",
battlevoice_chr010_105,"What a delightful body you have. Let me mess it up for you!",
battlevoice_chr010_106,"That's my line, King of the Sword. How about you scurry back to Avalon?",
battlevoice_chr010_107,"How do you put up with this one, Ciel?",
battlevoice_chr010_108,Hehe. Do you want to play for a bit?,
battlevoice_chr010_109,Hm... I have no use for this.,
battlevoice_chr010_660,The biggest nuisances always show up at the worst times.,
battlevoice_chr010_661,"I nearly forgot about you, snake. Wanna come get crushed underfoot again?",
battlevoice_chr010_110,Hmm... So that's something you can do...,
battlevoice_chr010_111,Ready to go again?,
battlevoice_chr010_112,It's not enough to cut you into pieces.,
battlevoice_chr010_113,You're real tough for a lifeform from the planet's surface.,
battlevoice_chr010_114,I guess you're more interesting than I first thought.,
battlevoice_chr010_115,Seems you wanna go out together with this city of yours.,
battlevoice_chr010_120,"Kneel, cur.",
battlevoice_chr010_662,"Kneel, cur.",
battlevoice_chr010_121,What a meager voice. Doesn't give me much to be exicted about.,
battlevoice_chr010_663,What a meager voice. Doesn't give me much to be exicted about.,
battlevoice_chr010_664,Well? Feel like dying yet?,
battlevoice_chr010_122,"Come on! You'll have to do better than that! If not, you'll die!",
battlevoice_chr010_123,"So, do you realize what you're up against yet?",
battlevoice_chr010_652,"So, do you realize what you're up against yet?",
battlevoice_chr010_124,"I'm this close to getting my revenge. Where will you run to next, Shiki?",
battlevoice_chr010_640,"I need to hold back a bit, this is worth savoring some more.",
battlevoice_chr010_650,"You have a body worth defacing... I love it.",
battlevoice_chr010_651,You got off already? How about another round?,
battlevoice_chr010_130,"That's it, huh? Guess I shouldn't be surprised.",
battlevoice_chr010_653,"That's it, huh? Guess I shouldn't be surprised.",
battlevoice_chr010_666,"That's it, huh? Guess I shouldn't be surprised.",
battlevoice_chr010_131,That wasn't even enough to pass the time.,
battlevoice_chr010_667,That wasn't even enough to pass the time.,
battlevoice_chr010_668,I don't believe this. What am I doing?,
battlevoice_chr010_132,My body feels so sluggish. This is what happens when you put up a facade for so long.,
battlevoice_chr010_133,Heheh... heheheh.... Hahahahaha!,
battlevoice_chr010_669,Heheh... heheheh.... Hahahahaha!,
battlevoice_chr010_134,"Ahh, this is so good! The way you break so easily! I can't get enough!",
battlevoice_chr010_135,Huh? You're finished already? No way! I didn't even get off myself...,
battlevoice_chr010_641,"Oh, that's it? That wasn't any fun at all...",
battlevoice_chr010_642,Did you think you'd be Event Stored? You'll have to suffer like this for the rest of your life!,
battlevoice_chr010_643,"A real shame. If you'd been a bit more clever, you might have been able to kill me.",
battlevoice_chr010_644,Aren't you a bit too weak?! That dumb reptile would have put up more of a fight!,
battlevoice_chr010_654,"Well, I suppose that killed a little time.",
battlevoice_chr010_655,You just keep prickling me. How annoying can one person be?,
battlevoice_chr010_656,I'm disappointed. You're even more broken than I am.,
battlevoice_chr010_150,Damn... You're better than I thought...,
battlevoice_chr010_151,I hate rules with these kinds of minutiae!,
battlevoice_chr011_100,Are you finished repenting?,
battlevoice_chr011_101,Shall we have a little after-meal workout?,
battlevoice_chr011_102,I'm sending your soul to purgatory.,
battlevoice_chr011_103,"Let's see, how should I take care of this?",
battlevoice_chr011_104,"But first, I'll splatter that crazed brain of yours onto the pavement.",
battlevoice_chr011_105,"Unfortunately, the Seventh Scripture is a very costly weapon.",
battlevoice_chr011_106,I don't approve of late-night loitering! I hope you'll agree to be taken in!,
battlevoice_chr011_107,"Your reincarnations meet their end, Serpent of Akasha.",
battlevoice_chr011_109,"Let's see, what would be the best way to clean up this mess?",
battlevoice_chr011_113,Time to receive judgment.,
battlevoice_chr011_114,Shall we have a little pre-meal workout?,
battlevoice_chr011_780,So you've lost your sani-- No... I guess you never had any to begin with.,
battlevoice_chr011_781,"As an Executor, it is my duty to eliminate vampires.",
battlevoice_chr011_750,Good Lord...,
battlevoice_chr011_751,Are you keeping up with your duties?,
battlevoice_chr011_752,Catch your breath before you try to speak.,
battlevoice_chr011_110,My eyes have been opened.,
battlevoice_chr011_111,You are better than I had anticipated.,
battlevoice_chr011_112,"No more fooling around, then.",
battlevoice_chr011_120,"If you want to run, now's the chance.",
battlevoice_chr011_121,"Well, I guess that's that.",
battlevoice_chr011_122,Do you wish to continue?,
battlevoice_chr011_123,"*yawn*! Oh, my apologies.",
battlevoice_chr011_782,I'll be sure not to let up.,
battlevoice_chr011_783,I refuse to show you any openings.,
battlevoice_chr011_784,"Remaining armaments, confirmed. Moving in for the kill.",
battlevoice_chr011_770,Very well. Perhaps I can play a while longer.,
battlevoice_chr011_771,"Hehe. You are my junior, after all.",
battlevoice_chr011_772,Looks like you're more than just your Mystic Eyes.,
battlevoice_chr011_773,Sorry. I was so captivated that I forgot to hold back.,
battlevoice_chr011_753,Please stop pretending that you're down already.,
battlevoice_chr011_754,"You'll never stop being so lazy, will you?",
battlevoice_chr011_755,The real battle starts here.,
battlevoice_chr011_756,Disgusting. I will show you no sympathy.,
battlevoice_chr011_757,Allow me to show you how an Executor fights.,
battlevoice_chr011_130,You can make up for your sins by living your life right.,
battlevoice_chr011_131,Just kidding! I was only scaring you a bit there.,
battlevoice_chr011_132,"You really made me work for this, didn't you?",
battlevoice_chr011_133,"You just had to interrupt me right before dinner, didn't you?",
battlevoice_chr011_135,Just kidding! I was only scaring you a bit there.,
battlevoice_chr011_775,Just kidding! I was only scaring you a bit there.,
battlevoice_chr011_136,"Alright, guess I'll leave the aftermath to the Acting Presbyter.",
battlevoice_chr011_137,"Okay, we're done here! Be more careful next time!",
battlevoice_chr011_785,I'll make up for your sins by taking your life.,
battlevoice_chr011_786,"Phew, I managed to somehow take her out.",
battlevoice_chr011_787,Hm? That was a bit milder to the taste than I imagined.,
battlevoice_chr011_774,Let's head straight to the tea-ceremony clubroom!,
battlevoice_chr011_762,"Ashes to ashes, dust to dust. The time for reckoning has come.",
battlevoice_chr011_776,"Phew, that was close.",
battlevoice_chr011_777,You were basically completely helpless. How pathetic.,
battlevoice_chr011_758,That's enough. Good work today.,
battlevoice_chr011_759,I expect a full report by tomorrow.,
battlevoice_chr011_760,"You were quite decisive. It seems you've grown.",
battlevoice_chr011_761,Perhaps you should explore your strong points now and then?,
battlevoice_chr011_150,Time's up... I told you I'm not a morning person...,
battlevoice_chr011_151,This won't happen again!,
battlevoice_chr012_100,Let us begin.,
battlevoice_chr012_101,There is no need to hold back.,
battlevoice_chr012_102,You should fight me with everything you have.,
battlevoice_chr012_103,Now according to the resturant guide it's around he-- What?!,
battlevoice_chr012_104,A plum sandwich? There's something about it that reminds me of home.,
battlevoice_chr012_105,A high-purity elemental...?! I didn't expect to find any of those remaining!,
battlevoice_chr012_106,I accept your challenge.,
battlevoice_chr012_107,I would prefer to remain inconspicuous.,
battlevoice_chr012_110,The real battle begins now.,
battlevoice_chr012_111,Let us continue this.,
battlevoice_chr012_112,Retreat was never an option.,
battlevoice_chr012_120,Please bring your best.,
battlevoice_chr012_121,Stand back up. Our fight is only beginning.,
battlevoice_chr012_122,I feel like I'm in good form.,
battlevoice_chr012_123,Feel free to use your full strength.,
battlevoice_chr012_130,That was a good fight.,
battlevoice_chr012_131,A knight's vow is unbreakable.,
battlevoice_chr012_132,"Even if I'm a little out of my element, I struggled far too much.",
battlevoice_chr012_133,That was a satisfying match.,
battlevoice_chr012_135,That was a pleasant fight.,
battlevoice_chr012_136,You still have much to learn.,
battlevoice_chr012_137,An excellent show of skill.,
battlevoice_chr012_150,I misjudged the state of the battlefield...,
battlevoice_chr012_151,Time's up?! I didn't realize that was a thing!,
battlevoice_chr013_100,"Alright, here I come!",
battlevoice_chr013_101,I'll show you how much my kung fu has improved!,

battlevoice_chr013_133,Hehehe! A flawless victory!,
battlevoice_chr013_720,Alright! A flawless victory!,
battlevoice_chr013_730,"Hehehe! Caught you, Shiki!",
battlevoice_chr013_741,"Shiki is my brother, and mine alone!",

battlevoice_chr004_701,"Right, let's do this.",
battlevoice_chr004_702,"We taking care of the mess, then?",
battlevoice_chr001_702,"It's our job, after all.",
battlevoice_chr004_703,Now then...,
battlevoice_chr001_703,Time to clean up.,
battlevoice_chr004_704,"Wow, looks pretty tough...!",
battlevoice_chr001_704,"Kohaku, be serious, please.",
battlevoice_chr000_680,But of course. I'm keeping myself at your level.,
battlevoice_chr000_681,"What? You can't do that, can you?!",
battlevoice_chr000_682,I could ask the newest Magician the same thing.,
battlevoice_chr003_670,Of course not. I've got nothing to be afraid of.,
battlevoice_chr003_671,"I see... Past saving, huh?,"
battlevoice_chr003_672,Sheesh. That's just like you.,
battlevoice_chr003_673,Right... this is the kinda person she was...,
battlevoice_chr003_674,Seriously? you're gonna see how I've been by fighting me?!,
battlevoice_chr003_680,Yeah... a strong one... from below... right to the jaw...,
battlevoice_chr003_681,"You're a real drill sergeant, you know...?",
battlevoice_chr003_682,It's fine... That won't be necessary.,
battlevoice_chr005_650,"Don't be like that, my fellow vampire. I promise this'll be electrifying.",
battlevoice_chr005_651,"What's wrong? I think you're lacking a bit of bloodlust, young lady!",
battlevoice_chr005_652,"That was a long time ago. As you can see, I'm more of an outlaw now!",
battlevoice_chr008_690,That's Roa's current form...?,
battlevoice_chr010_680,"What an annoying little cranefly. Wait, I get it. You want to be squashed.",
battlevoice_chr010_681,"You look happy. Perfect, all the better when I make you grovel.",
battlevoice_chr010_682,An unpleasant lapdog of the order... I'll get rid of you here and now.,
battlevoice_chr011_790,I hope that's indeed the case.,
battlevoice_chr011_791,(Heehee... We match... since we both wear glasses!),
battlevoice_chr011_792,"Ha-ha-ha. No idea who you might be, but I'll be taking you down, okay?",
battlevoice_chr014_100,"The hooorrifying rabbit hunt starts now, 'kay?",
battlevoice_chr014_101,"You want to be played with, dontcha? C'mon, don't hold back, say it.",
battlevoice_chr014_102,"Okay, Reality done Åô Don't worry, I'll reset you! \sf000",
battlevoice_chr014_103,I wonder what kind of screams this toy'll let out?,
battlevoice_chr014_104,Really? You actually think this is even gonna be a fight?,
battlevoice_chr014_105,"Hey, are you feeling the jitters? Can't get enough?",
battlevoice_chr014_110,Humans are just sooo pathetic! \sf000,
battlevoice_chr014_111,"Not running from me, huh? What a bad boy. \sf000",
battlevoice_chr014_112,What's this? I think I might be able to handle you after all.,
battlevoice_chr014_113,What IS that thing?! Nobody told me about this!,
battlevoice_chr014_114,"And you are...? Please, come back to me in Ciel's body instead.",
battlevoice_chr014_115,"Right, now that you've been found by me, you are, Shiki!",
battlevoice_chr014_125,This is sooo wonderful!,
battlevoice_chr014_126,"Ahhh, I tore them apart \sf000",

battlevoice_chr014_128,I'm at the top of my game!,
battlevoice_chr014_130,"Oh you poor thing, did you finish prematurely?",
battlevoice_chr014_131,"We'll continue this in a dream, 'kay?",
battlevoice_chr014_132,"Wait, wait, giving up already? That's pathetic!",
battlevoice_chr014_133,"Another elegant victory!ÅÙ I am a vampire, after all.Åô",
battlevoice_chr014_134,You little... You sure gave me a hard time given how weak you were.,
battlevoice_chr014_135,"Oh no, what a weakling! Guess I'll take it home to play some more, then!",
battlevoice_chr014_116,Haha... Ahahaha! Yay! Now I'm stronger than you!,
battlevoice_chr014_117,"C'mon, look! Everyone's dead because of you.",
battlevoice_chr014_118,"Hah, isn't that what you want to tell yourself, hypocrite?",
battlevoice_chr014_630,How is it? Is it starting to sink in?,
battlevoice_chr014_631,Hahaha! You look sooo pathetic.,
battlevoice_chr014_632,Get up. Weren't you supposed to be unbeatable?,
battlevoice_chr014_633,What are you scheming...?,
battlevoice_chr014_640,Ahahaha! Serves you right!,
battlevoice_chr014_641,You're not getting up anymore? Really?,
battlevoice_chr014_642,"I won...! I won against her fair and square, I really did it!",
battlevoice_chr014_643,"You're so slow... You're not going soft on me, are you? Ridiculous.",
battlevoice_chr015_100,"Hm? What, you wanna battle? Sure, sure. That's what travel's all about!",
battlevoice_chr015_101,I'm getting a bit excited.,
battlevoice_chr015_102,"Don't go too hard on me, okay?",
battlevoice_chr015_103,"Not gonna hold back, hope that's okay? Also, taking all your stuff.",
battlevoice_chr015_104,"Oh, I'll take you up on that fight!",
battlevoice_chr015_105,Shall we have a little after-meal workout?,
battlevoice_chr015_110,Should the esteemed Princess really be wandering around out here?,
battlevoice_chr015_111,"Feel free to cut loose, I'll bring my max in kind!",
battlevoice_chr015_112,Let's have ourselves a quick match!,
battlevoice_chr015_113,Wild  MENTOR  has  appeared!,
battlevoice_chr015_114,"'Course, seeing is believing, after all.",
battlevoice_chr015_115,Get over here. I'll take you on.,
battlevoice_chr015_116,Weren't you more of a theologian rather than a Dead Apostle?,
battlevoice_chr015_117,"Hey, I know that store! Let's go there when we're done.",
battlevoice_chr015_118,You're Shiki's sister? Really...?,
battlevoice_chr015_119,This girl... Doesn't she look a little like me?,
battlevoice_chr015_120,"(Oh, seems Shiki's told her about me!)",
battlevoice_chr015_121,"I'll have to politely decline. It's not easy coming back, you know?",
battlevoice_chr015_135,"One point for me, I guess!",
battlevoice_chr015_136,"You've got more than that, right?",
battlevoice_chr015_137,Just how I imagined it!,
battlevoice_chr015_138,Neither of us can afford to let our focus slip.,
battlevoice_chr015_140,"Sorry! Seems my kick really got you, huh?",
battlevoice_chr015_141,Focus. We're going again.,
battlevoice_chr015_145,Mmm-hmm! You've still got a ways to go.,
battlevoice_chr015_146,I hope this proved a useful learning experience.,
battlevoice_chr015_147,"Let us meet again, should fate so decree.",
battlevoice_chr015_148,"Whoops, did I knock you out?",
battlevoice_chr015_149,That was a fun time. Wanna go again?,
battlevoice_chr015_150,"We only got to the warmup? Sorry, I don't really hold back.",
battlevoice_chr015_151,"Oops, was that too much? Sorry, you still in there? I could treat you to some K-BBQ!",
battlevoice_chr000_683,Hm? Isn't it against the rules to gear up like that in the middle of town?,
battlevoice_chr000_684,"What am I thinking? Just about the date, of course!",
battlevoice_chr003_675,"Phew. Practical battle experience, huh?",
battlevoice_chr003_676,"(Wait, is she being serious? Or is she just mad at me?)",
battlevoice_chr003_677,I could say the same for you and the dangerous guards you have with you.,
battlevoice_chr005_653,"Wait-wait-wait, is that the real thing?",
battlevoice_chr005_654,Then how about a song? Perhaps you could play me a tarantella?,
battlevoice_chr005_655,"Well, it appears things must be quite fun on your end as well.",
battlevoice_chr008_691,Alrighty! Time to pretend I'm just showing off my skills so I can beat him up!,
battlevoice_chr008_692,"Oh wow, what an honor, ha-ha-ha...! Tch.",
battlevoice_chr010_683,"Maybe. I don't feel like drinking human blood in the slightest, though.",
battlevoice_chr010_684,Heheh. I think I just found my new favorite plaything.,
battlevoice_chr010_685,I remember telling you that I'd show no mercy next we meet.,
battlevoice_chr010_686,It was. It hurt so much you'd almost think my head had come off.,
battlevoice_chr010_687,"You're the leader. You should spill your own blood for once, Bestino",
battlevoice_chr011_793,"Undercover again, Acting Presbyter?",
battlevoice_chr011_794,"Worry not, I'm only fighting you as an Executor right now.",
battlevoice_chr014_119,"You're not getting away that easily, you little shit Åô",
battlevoice_chr014_109,Hah! You're a spiteful little shit to the last!,
battlevoice_chr015_122,You look a bit young for someone using such an ancient weapon.,
battlevoice_chr015_123,"Hmm, I think you're a pretty big deal yourself though?",
battlevoice_chr015_124,Don't you think the world could use one of those anyway?,
battlevoice_chr016_100,Spare the introductions. All I wish to hear are your pleas for mercy.,
battlevoice_chr016_101,Do not try to defend your actions. Now get ready.,
battlevoice_chr016_102,"After you've neutralized the target, bring them in for questioning if they're still alive.",
battlevoice_chr016_103,They're just heavy weaponry. Something the matter?,
battlevoice_chr016_104,"Blaze, Blade, Break... Safety locks, disengaged.",
battlevoice_chr016_105,I'm not here to play. I will simply subdue.,
battlevoice_chr016_106,Commencing purge.,
battlevoice_chr016_107,The unclean shall meet a fitting end.,
battlevoice_chr016_108,The time for judgment has come.,
battlevoice_chr016_109,No... this is the result of your own weakness.,
battlevoice_chr016_110,"So, you've stooped as low as to become a Dead Apostle, Noel?",
battlevoice_chr016_111,The Fifth Magician... I didn't think I would come across you here.,
battlevoice_chr016_112,"Acting Presbyter or not, if you get in my way, I will eliminate you.",
battlevoice_chr016_113,It was on my own initiative. You'll have to employ force to stop me.,
battlevoice_chr016_114,"Of course it is. Your voyage ends here, Michael Roa Valdamjong.",
battlevoice_chr016_120,Is there still life in you?,
battlevoice_chr016_121,You should thank the Lord for that sturdy body of yours.,
battlevoice_chr016_122,Scanning armaments... No malfunctions.,
battlevoice_chr016_123,Did your life perhaps flash before your eyes?,
battlevoice_chr016_125,"The enemy won't wait, now get up.",
battlevoice_chr016_130,Inquisitioning complete.,
battlevoice_chr016_131,I shall bring fitting punishment for your sins.,
battlevoice_chr016_132,"It appears this is where it ends. A shame, really.",
battlevoice_chr016_133,No gear-malfunctions detected. Proceeding to next target.,
battlevoice_chr016_134,Are you prepared to face the consequences?,
battlevoice_chr016_135,How very predictable.,
battlevoice_chr016_136,"It's over, Serpent of Akasha. Your soul has crumbled.",
battlevoice_chr016_700,"Looks like your sanity... is still intact, even if by a small margin.",
battlevoice_chr016_701,You've been consumed by your vampiric urges. How pitiful.,
battlevoice_chr016_702,"Oh I see, you enjoy it when your ""playthings"" kill you.",
battlevoice_chr016_705,Feel free to enjoy your victory.,
battlevoice_chr016_706,I've no choice but to play my trump card...,
battlevoice_chr016_707,Stay calm... stay calm...,
battlevoice_chr016_710,"You're even more ""playful"" than usual.",
battlevoice_chr016_711,"You're like a broken faucet, running wild.",
battlevoice_chr016_712,A dump truck has more elegance than you.,
battlevoice_chr016_715,Even you won't be getting up from that any time soon.,
battlevoice_chr016_716,I would never celebrate my victory... But today I'm gonna eat loads at Messiaen!,
battlevoice_chr016_717,I can't believe it... I did it! Take THAT!,
battlevoice_chr016_718,At the end of the day, you're just a vampire. This is the end.,
battlevoice_chr016_750,Yes. Resist me with everything you've got.,
battlevoice_chr016_751,"Think of me as Arc-- I mean, just another vampire.",
battlevoice_chr016_760,It's fine. I'm not mad at all.,
battlevoice_chr016_761,This was only supposed to be a training exercise...,
battlevoice_chr016_762,"Alright, I'll get a bit serious now.",
battlevoice_chr016_770,Do you require medical assistance?,
battlevoice_chr016_771,You put up a good fight. That sets me at ease.,
battlevoice_chr016_772,"Coming at me with just a single knife... I mean-- Uh, no, nothing!",
battlevoice_chr016_780,"He's out cold... Could this be my chance...? No, no! I have to behave myself! ",
battlevoice_chr016_781,"It's important to eat after a fight. By the way, I have curry waiting at home...",
battlevoice_chr016_782,"Once you really get into it, you're like a different person...",
battlevoice_chr016_783,"Hmm? You're not usually such a pushover, Shiki.",
battlevoice_chr017_100,Think you can just do whatever you like on MY island?,
battlevoice_chr017_101,"No need for repentin', just take a listen to one of my songs instead.",
battlevoice_chr017_102,My ensemble's so short on performers I gotta take the stage myself.,
battlevoice_chr017_103,"If you're looking to convert, now's the chance.",
battlevoice_chr017_104,"I'm real busy. Spill your business, nothin' more.",
battlevoice_chr017_105,"Take it easy, aight? You're fighting a kid for fuck's sake.",
